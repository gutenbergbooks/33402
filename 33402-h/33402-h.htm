<h2 id="preface">PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="first-word">A life</span> of Longfellow has been from the beginning
included in the plan of the “American
Men of Letters” series, but it has been delayed
through a variety of causes. Like all memoirs
of this poet, it must rest partly on the material
amply furnished by the “Life” so admirably
prepared by his brother sixteen years ago, yet it
may be well to explain that the present volume
will be found marked by three especial characteristics
of its own. First, much additional
material is here drawn from the manuscript
correspondence of the first Mrs. Longfellow,
received from her family and bearing upon the
poet’s early married years and first visit to
Europe, during what was undoubtedly the formative
period of his life. Secondly, there is a
good deal of material obtained from the manuscript
volumes known as the “Harvard College
Papers” and preserved at the University
Library, elucidating the academical side of
<span id="pg_iv" class="page_anchor">iv </span>Longfellow’s life. Thirdly, there is a series of
extracts from his earlier writings, dating from
college days and not hitherto brought together,
but showing the origin and growth of his lifelong
desire to employ American material and to
help the creation of a native literature; the
desire which had its final fulfilment in “Evangeline”
and “Hiawatha.” These three sources
will be found, if the author is not mistaken,
to have afforded distinct contributions to our
previous knowledge as to Longfellow’s character
and work.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER I<br>

<span class="title">LONGFELLOW AS A CLASSIC</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> death of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
made the first breach in that well-known group
of poets which adorned Boston and its vicinity
so long. The first to go was also the most
widely famous. Emerson reached greater depths
of thought; Whittier touched the problems of
the nation’s life more deeply; Holmes came personally
more before the public; Lowell was more
brilliant and varied; but, taking the English-speaking
world at large, it was Longfellow whose
fame overshadowed all the others; he was also
better known and more translated upon the continent
of Europe than all the rest put together,
and, indeed, than any other contemporary poet of
the English-speaking race, at least if bibliographies
afford any test. Add to this that his place
of residence was so accessible and so historic, his
<span id="pg_2" class="page_anchor">2 </span>personal demeanor so kindly, his life so open and
transparent, that everything really conspired to
give him the highest accessible degree of contemporary
fame. There was no literary laurel that
was not his, and he resolutely declined all other
laurels; he had wealth and ease, children and
grandchildren, health and a stainless conscience;
he had also, in a peculiar degree, the blessings
that belong to Shakespeare’s estimate of old age,—“honor,
love, obedience, troops of friends.”
Except for two great domestic bereavements, his
life would have been one of absolutely unbroken
sunshine; in his whole career he never encountered
any serious rebuff, while such were his
personal modesty and kindliness that no one
could long regard him with envy or antagonism.
Among all the sons of song there has
rarely been such an instance of unbroken and
unstained success.</p>

<p>Yet the fact that his death took place twenty
years ago may justly raise the question how far
this wave of success has followed his memory, or
how far the passage of time has impaired his
traditional influence; and here we must compare
a variety of tests and standards to ascertain the
result. Some analysis of this kind may well precede
any new attempt to delineate his career.</p>

<p>The editor of one of the great London weeklies
said to an American traveller not many years
<span id="pg_3" class="page_anchor">3 </span>ago, “A stranger can hardly have an idea of
how familiar many of our working people, especially
women, are with Longfellow. Thousands
can repeat some of his poems who have never
read a line of Tennyson and probably never
heard of Browning.” This passage I take from
an admirable recent sketch by Professor Edwin
A. Grosvenor of Amherst College, one of
the most cosmopolitan of Americans, who spent
seven years as professor of history at Robert
College, Constantinople. He goes on to tell
how, in the largest private library in the Ottoman
Empire, the grand vizier showed him as his
favorite book a large volume of Longfellow, full
of manuscript comments in Turkish on the margin,
adding that he knew some of the poems by
heart. Professor Grosvenor was at one time—in
1879—travelling by steamer from Constantinople
to Marseilles with a Russian lady who
had been placed under his escort, and whose nationality
could have been detected only by her
marvellous knowledge of half a dozen languages
beside her own. A party of passengers had
been talking in French of Victor Hugo, when
the Russian lady exclaimed in English to the
last speaker, “How can you, an American, give
to him the place that is occupied by your own
Longfellow? Longfellow is the universal poet.
He is better known, too, among foreigners, than
<span id="pg_4" class="page_anchor">4 </span>any one except their own poets!” She then
repeated the verses beginning, “I stood on the
bridge at midnight,” and added, “I long to visit
Boston, that I may stand on the bridge.” Then
an English captain, returning from the Zulu
war, said, “I can give you something better than
that,” and recited in a voice like a trumpet,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Tell me not, in mournful numbers,</div>
  <div class="line2">Life is but an empty dream.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Presently a gray-haired Scotchman began to recite
the poem,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“There is no flock, however watched and tended,</div>
<div class="line">But one dead lamb is there!”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An American contributed “My Lost Youth,”
being followed by a young Greek temporarily
living in England, who sang “Stars of the Summer
Night.” Finally the captain of the steamer,
an officer of the French navy detailed for that
purpose, whom nobody had suspected of knowing
a word of English, recited, in an accent hardly
recognizable, the first verse of “Excelsior,” and
when the Russian lady, unable to understand
him, denied the fact of its being English at all,
he replied, “Ah, oui, madame, ça a vient de votre
Longfellow” (Yes, madam, that is from your
Longfellow). Six nationalities had thus been
represented, and the Russian lady said, as they
rose from the table, “Do you suppose there is
any other poet of any country, living or dead,
<span id="pg_5" class="page_anchor">5 </span>from whom so many of us could have quoted?
Not one. Not even Shakespeare, or Victor
Hugo, or Homer.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_1" id="fnc_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>One has merely to glance at any detailed
catalogue of the translations from Longfellow’s
works—as for instance that given in the appendix
to this volume—to measure the vast extent
of his fame. The list includes thirty-five
versions of whole books or detached poems in
German, twelve in Italian, nine each in French
and Dutch, seven in Swedish, six in Danish, five
in Polish, three in Portuguese, two each in
Spanish, Russian, Hungarian, and Bohemian,
with single translations in Latin, Hebrew, Chinese,
Sanskrit, Marathi, and Judea-German—yielding
one hundred versions altogether, extending
into eighteen languages, apart from the
original English. There is no evidence that any
other English-speaking poet of the last century
has been so widely appreciated.</p>

<p>Especially is this relative superiority noticeable
in that wonderful literary cyclopædia, the
vast and many-volumed catalogue of the British
Museum. There, under each author’s name, is
found not merely the record of his works in
every successive edition, but every secondary or
relative book, be it memoir, criticism, attack,
parody, or translation; and it is always curious
<span id="pg_6" class="page_anchor">6 </span>to consider the relative standing of American
and English authors under this severe and inexorable
test. The entries or items appearing
in the interleaved catalogue under the name of
Tennyson, for instance, up to September, 1901,
were 487; under Longfellow, 357; then follow,
among English-writing poets, Browning (179),
Emerson (158), Arnold (140), Holmes (135),
Morris (117), Lowell (114), Whittier (104),
Poe (103), Swinburne (99), Whitman (64).
The nearest approach to a similar test of appreciation
in the poet’s own country is to be found
in the balloting for the new Hall of Fame, established
by an unknown donor on the grounds of
the New York University with the avowed object
of creating an American Westminster Abbey.
The names of those who were to appear in it
were selected by a board of one hundred judges
carefully chosen from men of all occupations
and distributed over every State in the Union;
and these balloted for the first hundred occupants
of the Hall of Fame. Only thirty-nine
names obtained a majority of votes, these being
taken, of course, from men of all pursuits; and
among these Longfellow ranked tenth, having
eighty-five votes, and being preceded only by
Washington, Lincoln, Webster, Franklin, Grant,
Marshall, Jefferson, Emerson, and Fulton. Besides
Emerson and Longfellow, only two literary
<span id="pg_7" class="page_anchor">7 </span>men were included, these being Irving with
eighty-four votes and Hawthorne with seventy-three.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that when the temporary
leader in any particular branch of literature
or science passes away, there is often visible a
slight reaction, perhaps in the interest of supposed
justice, when people try to convince themselves
that his fame has already diminished.
Such reactions have notably occurred, for instance,
in the cases of Scott, Byron, Wordsworth,
and even of Burns, yet without visible or permanent
results, while the weaker fame of Southey
or of Campbell has yielded to them. It is safe
to say that up to the present moment no serious
visible reaction has occurred in the case of
Longfellow. So absolutely simple and truthful
was his nature and so clear the response of the
mass of readers, that time has so far left his
hold upon them singularly unaffected. During
a recent visit to England, the author of this
volume took some pains, in every place he visited
in city or country, to inquire of the local bookseller
as to the demand for Longfellow’s poems,
and the answer was always in substance and
sometimes in express words, “He is a classic,”—in
other words, his books had a steady and
trustworthy sale. I always found his poems on
the shelves, and this was true of no other American
<span id="pg_8" class="page_anchor">8 </span>poet. Several editions of his works, single
or collective, had recently appeared in London.
Poems newly set to music had lately been published
at the music stalls, and familiar citations
from his poems were constantly heard in
public speeches. Inquiries similar to mine were
made a few years since in the book-stores of
Switzerland and Germany by my friend, Professor
W. J. Rolfe, who found without difficulty
the German and English text of single or
collected poems by Longfellow at Nuremberg,
Cologne, Strasburg, Lucerne, Interlaken, and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Another form of obtaining statistics bearing
on the relative position of Longfellow among
English-writing poets would be to inspect books
of selections made in Great Britain out of this
class. I find two such lying near at hand; the
first is “Pen and Pencil Pictures from the
Poets,” published by William P. Nimmo at
Edinburgh, containing fifty-six poems in all,
each with a full-page illustration, generally by
Scottish artists. Of these selections, six are
taken from Longfellow, five each from Wordsworth
and Thomson, and three each from
Shakespeare, Burns, and Moore. Of other
American poets Bryant and Willis alone appear,
each with one contribution. Another such book
is “Words from the Poets; selected for the use
<span id="pg_9" class="page_anchor">9 </span>of parochial schools and libraries.” To this the
leading contributors are Wordsworth (twenty-one),
Longfellow (eighteen), Cowper (eleven),
and Tennyson (nine), the whole number of contributors
being forty-three. Such statistics could
be easily multiplied; indeed, it will be readily
admitted that no American poet can be compared
to Longfellow in the place occupied by
his poems in the English market. Readily admitting
that this is not the sole or highest
standard, it must at least be recognized as one of
the side tests by which that standard may be
determined.</p>

<p>Some occasional expressions of distrust as to
Longfellow’s permanent fame have been based
wholly upon his virtues. Many still cling to
Dryden’s maxim, “Great wits are sure to madness
near allied.” Those who grew up during
the period when the Lake poets of England
were still under discussion can well recall that
the typical poet was long supposed to be necessarily
something of a reprobate, or at any rate
wild and untamable; so that Byron and Shelley
gained in fame by the supposition that the domestic
and law-abiding gifts were far from them.
The prominence of Wordsworth was developed
in spite of this tradition, and even when the
report cheered some of his would-be admirers
that he had once been intoxicated at the university,
<span id="pg_10" class="page_anchor">10 </span>it was damped by the opinion expressed
by Theodore Hook that “Wordsworth’s conceptions
of inebriation were no doubt extremely
limited.” The popular impression in such matters
is too deep to be easily removed; and yet
every test continues to prove that the hold taken
on the average human heart by Longfellow is far
greater than that held, for instance, by Poe or
Whitman. This was practically conceded by
those poets themselves, and it is this fact which
in reality excited the wrath of their especial admirers.
No man ever sacrificed less for mere
fame than Longfellow, no man ever bore attack
or jealousy with more of manly self-respect and
sweetness; he simply lived his own life, and
worked out his own literary method; all that he
asked was to be taken for what he was worth,
and the world’s praise was the answer to his
request. The continuance of this hold on men
surely affords a sufficient reason for the renewed
study of this poet’s life, training, and career.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="title">BIRTH, CHILDHOOD, AND YOUTH</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</span> was born
in Portland, Maine, February 27, 1807, being the
son of Stephen and Zilpah (Wadsworth) Longfellow,
both his parents having been descended
from Yorkshire families which had migrated in
the seventeenth century. The name of Longfellow
first appears in English records as Langfellay,
while the name of Wadsworth sometimes
appears as Wordsworth, suggesting a possible
connection with another poet. His father,
Stephen Longfellow, was a graduate of Harvard
College in 1794, being a classmate of the Rev. Dr.
W. E. Channing and the Hon. Joseph Story. He
became afterward a prominent lawyer in Portland.
He was also at different times a member
of the Massachusetts Legislature, Maine being
then a part of that State; a member of the celebrated
“Hartford Convention” of Federalists;
a presidential elector, and a member of Congress.
In earlier generations the poet’s grandfather
was a judge of the Court of Common
Pleas; his great-grandfather was a graduate of
<span id="pg_12" class="page_anchor">12 </span>Harvard College in 1742, and was afterward
town schoolmaster, parish clerk, and register
of probate; his great-great-grandfather was a
“village blacksmith;” and his ancestor once more
removed, the American founder of the family,
was William Longfellow, who was born in
Hampshire County, England, in 1651, and came
in early life to this country, where he engaged
in mercantile pursuits. Thus much for the
paternal ancestry.</p>

<p>To turn to the “spindle side,” Mr. Longfellow’s
mother was Zilpah Wadsworth, eldest
daughter of General Peleg Wadsworth, who was
the son of Deacon Peleg Wadsworth, of Duxbury,
Mass., and was the fifth in descent from
Christopher Wadsworth, who came from England
and settled in that town before 1632. The
Peleg Wadsworth of military fame was born at
Duxbury, and graduated from Harvard in 1769;
he afterward taught school at Plymouth, and married
Elizabeth Bartlett of that town; he then took
part in the Revolution as captain of a company
of minutemen, and rose to a major-general’s
command, serving chiefly on the eastern frontier.
He was captured, was imprisoned, escaped,
and had many stirring adventures. When the
war was over he purchased from the State no less
than 7500 acres of wild land, and spent the rest of
his life at Hiram, Maine, representing his congressional
<span id="pg_13" class="page_anchor">13 </span>district, however, for fourteen years
in the national Congress. Through the Wadsworths
and Bartletts, the poet could trace his
descent to not less than four of the Mayflower
pilgrims, including Elder Brewster and Captain
John Alden.</p>

<p>Judge Longfellow, the poet’s grandfather, is
described as having been “a fine-looking gentleman
with the bearing of the old school; an erect,
portly figure, rather tall; wearing, almost to the
close of his life, the old-style dress,—long skirted
waistcoat, small-clothes, and white-topped boots,
his hair tied behind in a club, with black ribbon.”
General Wadsworth was described by
his daughter as “a man of middle size, well proportioned,
with a military air, and who carried
himself so truly that men thought him tall.
His dress a bright scarlet coat, buff small-clothes
and vest, full ruffled bosom, ruffles over the
hands, white stockings, shoes with silver buckles,
white cravat with bow in front, hair well
powdered and tied behind in a club, so called.”
The poet was eminently well descended, both
on the father’s and mother’s side, according to
the simple provincial standard of those days.</p>

<p>Stephen Longfellow and his young wife lived
for a time in a brick house built by General
Wadsworth in Portland, and still known as “the
Longfellow house;” but it was during a temporary
<span id="pg_14" class="page_anchor">14 </span>residence of the family at the house of
Samuel Stephenson, whose wife was a sister of
Stephen Longfellow, that Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow was born. He was the second son,
and was named for an uncle, Henry Wadsworth,
a young naval lieutenant, who was killed
in 1804 by the explosion of a fire-ship, before
the walls of Tripoli. The Portland of 1807
was, according to Dr. Dwight,—who served as a
sort of travelling inspector of the New England
towns of that period,—“beautiful and brilliant;”
but the blight of the Embargo soon fell
upon it. The town needed maritime defences
in the war of 1812, and a sea-fight took place
off the coast, the British brig Boxer being captured
during the contest by the Enterprise, and
brought into Portland harbor in 1813. All this
is beautifully chronicled in the poem “My Lost
Youth:”—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“I remember the sea-fight far away,</div>
  <div class="line2">How it thundered o’er the tide!</div>
<div class="line">And the dead captains, as they lay</div>
<div class="line">In their graves, o’erlooking the tranquil bay</div>
  <div class="line2">Where they in battle died.</div>
      <div class="line4">And the sound of that mournful song</div>
      <div class="line4">Goes through me with a thrill;</div>
      <div class="line4">‘A boy’s will is the wind’s will,</div>
<div class="line">And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.’”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here Henry Longfellow spent his childhood
and youth. Much of that strong aversion to
<span id="pg_15" class="page_anchor">15 </span>war which pervades the poet’s verses may undoubtedly
be charged to early association with
his uncle’s death.</p>

<p>The imaginative side of his temperament has
commonly been attributed to his mother, who
was fond of poetry and music, and a lover of
nature in all its aspects; one who would sit by
a window during a thunderstorm, as her youngest
son has testified, “enjoying the excitement
of its splendors.” She loved the retirement of
a country life, and found in it, in her own language,
“a wonderful effect in tranquillizing the
spirit and calming every unpleasant emotion.”
She played the spinet until her daughter’s piano
replaced it, and apparently read Cowper, Hannah
More, and Ossian with her children. She
sent them early to school, after the fashion
of those days; this experience evidently beginning
for Henry Longfellow at three years of
age, when he went with a brother of five to a
private school where he learned his letters.
After several experiments, he was transferred, at
the tolerably early age of six, to the Portland
Academy. At this age, his teacher, Mr. Carter,
wrote of him, “Master Henry Longfellow is one
of the best boys we have in school. He spells
and reads very well. He also can add and multiply
numbers. His conduct last quarter was
very correct and amiable.” He began early to
<span id="pg_16" class="page_anchor">16 </span>rhyme, and the first poem of his composing
which is known to be preserved in manuscript
is entitled, “Venice, an Italian Song,” and was
dated Portland Academy, March 17, 1820, he
being then barely thirteen. There appeared a
little later, in the poets’ corner of the Portland
“Gazette,” the following verses, which show
curiously, at the very outset, that vibration between
foreign themes and home themes which
always marks his verse:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="title">THE BATTLE OF LOVELL’S POND</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Cold, cold is the north wind and rude is the blast</div>
<div class="line">That sweeps like a hurricane loudly and fast,</div>
<div class="line">As it moans through the tall waving pines lone and drear,</div>
<div class="line">Sighs a requiem sad o’er the warrior’s bier.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The war-whoop is still, and the savage’s yell</div>
<div class="line">Has sunk into silence along the wild dell;</div>
<div class="line">The din of the battle, the tumult, is o’er,</div>
<div class="line">And the war-clarion’s voice is now heard no more.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The warriors that fought for their country, and bled,</div>
<div class="line">Have sunk to their rest; the damp earth is their bed;</div>
<div class="line">No stone tells the place where their ashes repose,</div>
<div class="line">Nor points out the spot from the graves of their foes.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">They died in their glory, surrounded by fame,</div>
<div class="line">And Victory’s loud trump their death did proclaim;</div>
<div class="line">They are dead; but they live in each Patriot’s breast,</div>
<div class="line">And their names are engraven on honor’s bright crest.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These verses cannot be assigned to the domain
of high art, most certainly, but they mark in this
<span id="pg_17" class="page_anchor">17 </span>case the beginning of a career, and milestones
are always interesting. It was Longfellow’s first
poem, and he chose an American subject. We
know from him the circumstances of the reception
of this youthful effort. When the morning
paper arrived it was unfolded and read by his
father, and no notice was taken of the effusion;
but when, in the evening, the boy went with his
father to the house of Judge Mellen, his father’s
friend, whose son Frederic was his own playmate,
the talk turned upon poetry. The host
took up the morning’s “Gazette.” “Did you
see the piece in to-day’s paper? Very stiff. Remarkably
stiff; moreover, it is all borrowed,
every word of it.” No defence was offered. It
is recorded that there were tears on the young
boy’s pillow that night.</p>

<p>The young Henry Longfellow went to various
schools, as those of Mrs. Fellows and Mr. Carter,
and the Portland Academy, then kept by Mr.
Bezaleel Cushman, a Dartmouth College graduate.
In 1821, he passed the entrance examinations
of Bowdoin College, of which his father was
a trustee. The college itself was but twenty years
old, and Maine had only just become an independent
State of the Union, so that there was a
strong feeling of local pride in this young institution.
Henry Longfellow’s brother, Stephen,
two years older than himself, passed the examinations
<span id="pg_18" class="page_anchor">18 </span>with him, but perhaps it was on account
of the younger brother’s youth—he being only
fourteen—that the boys remained a year longer
at home, and did not go to Brunswick until the
beginning of the Sophomore year. Henry’s college
life was studious and modest. He and Nathaniel
Hawthorne were classmates, having been
friends rather than intimates, and Hawthorne
gives in his “Fanshawe” a tolerably graphic
picture of the little rural college. Neither of
the two youths cared much for field sports, but
both of them were greatly given to miscellaneous
reading; and both of them also spent a good
deal of time in the woods of Brunswick, which
were, and still are, beautiful. Longfellow pursued
the appointed studies, read poetry, was fond
of Irving, and also of books about the Indians,
an experience which in later life yielded him
advantage.</p>

<p>It is just possible that these books may have
revived in him a regret expressed in one of his
early college letters that he had not gone to West
Point instead of Bowdoin,—some opportunity
of appointment to the military school, perhaps
through his uncle, General Wadsworth, having
possibly been declined in his behalf.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_2" id="fnc_2">[2]</a> It is curious
indeed to reflect that had he made this
<span id="pg_19" class="page_anchor">19 </span>different selection, he might have been known to
fame simply as Major-General Longfellow.</p>

<p>Hon. J. W. Bradbury, another classmate, describes
Henry Longfellow as having “a slight,
erect figure, delicate complexion, and intelligent
expression of countenance,” and further adds:
“He was always a gentleman in his deportment,
and a model in his character and habits.” Still
another classmate, Rev. David Shepley, D. D.,
has since written of Longfellow’s college course:
“He gave urgent heed to all departments of
study in the prescribed course, and excelled in
them all; while his enthusiasm moved in the
direction it has taken in subsequent life. His
themes, felicitous translations of Horace, and occasional
contributions to the press, drew marked
attention to him, and led to the expectation that
his would be an honorable literary career.” He
spent his vacations in Portland, where the society
was always agreeable, and where the women,
as one of his companions wrote, seemed to him
“something enshrined and holy,—to be gazed
at and talked with, and nothing further.” In
one winter vacation he spent a week in Boston
and attended a ball given by Miss Emily Marshall,
the most distinguished of Boston’s historic
belles, and further famous as having been the
object of two printed sonnets, the one by Willis
and the other by Percival. He wrote to his
<span id="pg_20" class="page_anchor">20 </span>father that on this occasion he saw and danced
with Miss Eustaphiève, daughter of the Russian
consul, of whom he says, “She is an exceedingly
graceful and elegant dancer, and plays beautifully
upon the pianoforte.” He became so well
acquainted in later days with foreign belles and
beauties that it is interesting to imagine the impression
made upon him at the age of twenty-one
by this first social experience, especially in
view of the fact that after his returning from
Europe, he records of himself that he never
danced, except with older ladies, to whom the
attention might give pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="title">FIRST FLIGHTS IN AUTHORSHIP</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">It</span> is interesting to know that twice, during
his college days, Longfellow had occasion to
show his essentially American feeling; first, in
his plea for the Indians on an Exhibition Day,
and again, more fully and deliberately, in his
Commencement Oration on “Our Native Writers.”
On Exhibition Day,—a sort of minor
Commencement,—he represented, in debate, an
American Indian, while his opponent, James W.
Bradbury, took the part of an English emigrant.
The conclusion of the exercise summed up the
whole, being as follows:—</p>

<p>“<em>Emigrant.</em>—Is it thus you should spurn all
our offers of kindness, and glut your appetite
with the blood of our countrymen, with no excuse
but the mere pretence of retaliation? Shall the
viper sting us and we not bruise his head? Shall
we not only let your robberies and murders pass
unpunished, but give you the possession of our
very fireside, while the only arguments you offer
are insolence and slaughter? Know ye, the land
is ours until you will improve it. Go, tell your
<span id="pg_22" class="page_anchor">22 </span>ungrateful comrades the world declares the spread
of the white people at the expense of the red is
the triumph of peace over violence. Tell them
to cease their outrages upon the civilized world
or but a few days and they shall be swept from
the earth.</p>

<p>“<em>Savage.</em>—Alas! the sky is overcast with
dark and blustering clouds. The rivers run with
blood, but never, never will we suffer the grass
to grow upon our war-path. And now I do remember
that the Initiate prophet, in my earlier
years, told from his dreams that all our race
should fall like withered leaves when autumn
strips the forest! Lo! I hear sighing and sobbing:
’tis the death-song of a mighty nation,
the last requiem over the grave of the fallen.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_3" id="fnc_3">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is fair to conjecture that we may have in
this boyish performance the very germ of “Hiawatha,”
and also to recall the still more youthful
verses which appeared in the Portland “Gazette.”
He wrote in college not merely such
verses, but some prose articles for the “American
Monthly Magazine,” edited in Philadelphia,
by Dr. James McHenry, who in his letters
praised the taste and talent shown in the article
upon “Youth and Age.” More important to
the young poet, however, was his connection
with a new semi-monthly periodical called the
<span id="pg_23" class="page_anchor">23 </span>“United States Literary Gazette.” This was
published in Boston and New York simultaneously,
having been founded by the late Theophilus
Parsons, but edited at that time by James
G. Carter, of Boston, well known in connection
with the history of public schools. Apparently
Longfellow must have offered poems to the
“Gazette” anonymously, for one of his classmates
records that when he met Mr. Carter in
Boston the editor asked with curiosity what
young man sent him such fine poetry from Bowdoin
College. A modest volume of “Miscellaneous
Poems, selected from the ‘United States
Literary Gazette,’” appeared in 1826,—the year
after Longfellow left college,—and it furnished
by far the best exhibit of the national poetry
up to that time. The authors represented were
Bryant, Longfellow, Percival, Dawes, Mellen,
and Jones; and it certainly offered a curious
contrast to that equally characteristic volume of
1794, the “Columbian Muse,” whose poets were
Barlow, Trumbull, Freneau, Dwight, Humphreys,
and a few others, not a single poem or
poet being held in common by the two collections.</p>

<p>This was, however, only a volume of extracts,
but it is the bound volumes of the “Gazette”
itself—beginning with April 1, 1824—which
most impress the student of early American
<span id="pg_24" class="page_anchor">24 </span>literature. There will always be a charm in
turning over the pages where one sees, again
and again, the youthful poems of Bryant and of
Longfellow placed side by side and often put
together on the same page, the young undergraduate’s
effusions being always designated by
his initials and Bryant’s with a perhaps more
dignified “B.,” denoting one whose reputation
was to a certain extent already established, so
that a hint was sufficient. Bryant’s poems, it
must be owned, are in this case very much better
or at least maturer than those of his youthful
rival, and are preserved in his published works,
while Longfellow’s are mainly those which he
himself dropped, though they are reprinted in
the appendix to Mr. Scudder’s “Cambridge” edition
of his poems. We find thus in the “Literary
Gazette,” linked together on the same page,
Longfellow’s “Autumnal Nightfall” and Bryant’s
“Song of the Grecian Amazon;” Longfellow’s
“Italian Scenery” and Bryant’s “To a
Cloud;” Longfellow’s “Lunatic Girl” and
Bryant’s “The Murdered Traveller.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_4" id="fnc_4">[4]</a> How
the older poet was impressed by the work of
the younger we cannot tell, but it is noticeable
that in editing a volume of selected American
poetry not long after, he assigns to Longfellow,
as will presently be seen, a very small
<span id="pg_25" class="page_anchor">25 </span>space. It is to be remembered that Bryant had
previously published in book form, in 1821, his
earliest poems, and the “Literary Gazette” itself,
in its very first number, had pronounced him
the first “original poet formed on this side of
the Atlantic.” “Our pleasure was equalled by
our surprise,” it says, “when we took up Bryant’s
poems, listened to the uncommon melody
of the versification, wondered at the writer’s
perfect command of language, and found that
they were American poems.” “Though the
English critics say of him,” it continues, “that
their poets must look to their laurels now that
such a competitor has entered the ring, yet, let
him remember that a few jousts in the ring
never established the reputation of a knight.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_5" id="fnc_5">[5]</a>
It is a curious fact that the difference in actual
quantity of poetic production between the older
and younger poets should thus have been unconsciously
suggested by the editor when Longfellow
was but seventeen.</p>

<p>With Bryant and Longfellow, it would therefore
seem, the permanent poetic literature of the
nation began. “The Rivulet” and “The Hymn
of the Moravian Nuns” appeared in the “Gazette”
collection, and have never disappeared
from the poetic cyclopædias. The volume included
fourteen of Longfellow’s youthful effusions,
<span id="pg_26" class="page_anchor">26 </span>only six of which he saw fit to preserve;
dropping behind him, perhaps wisely, the “Dirge
Over a Nameless Grave,” “Thanksgiving,”
“The Angler’s Song,” “Autumnal Nightfall,”
“A Song of Savoy,” “Italian Scenery,” “The
Venetian Gondolier,” and “The Sea Diver.”
He himself says of those which he preserved
that they were all written before the age of
nineteen, and this is obvious from the very date
of the volume. Even in the rejected poems
the reader recognizes an easy command of the
simpler forms of melody, and a quick though
not profound feeling for external nature. Where
he subsequently revises these poems, however,
the changes are apt to be verbal only, and all
evidently matters of the ear. Thus in reprinting
“The Woods in Winter,” he omits a single
verse, the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“On the gray maple’s crusted bark</div>
  <div class="line2">Its tender shoots the hoarfrost nips;</div>
<div class="line">Whilst in the frozen fountain—hark!</div>
  <div class="line2">His piercing beak the bittern dips.”</div>
</div>

<p>It shows the gradual development of the young
poet’s ear that he should have dropped this
somewhat unmelodious verse. As a rule he
wisely forbore the retouching of his early poems.
He also contributed to the “Gazette” three
articles in prose, quite in Irving’s manner, including
a few verses. All these attracted some
<span id="pg_27" class="page_anchor">27 </span>attention at the time. Mr. Parsons, the proprietor
of the magazine, was thoroughly convinced
of the vigor and originality of the young
man’s mind, and informed him that one of his
poems, “Autumnal Nightfall,” had been attributed
to Bryant, while his name was mentioned
in the “Galaxy” on a level with that of Bryant
and Percival. The leadership of Bryant was of
course unquestioned at that period, and Longfellow
many years after acknowledged to that
poet his indebtedness, saying, “When I look
back upon my early years, I cannot but smile
to see how much in them is really yours. It
was an involuntary imitation, which I most
readily confess.”</p>

<p>Still more interesting as a study in the “Literary
Gazette” itself are three prose studies, distinctly
after the manner of Irving, and headed
by a very un-American title, “The Lay Monastery.”
There is a singular parallelism between
this fanciful title and the similar transformation
in verse, at about the same time, in the “Hymn
of the Moravian Nuns” at the consecration of
Pulaski’s banner. As in that poem a plain Moravian
sisterhood, who supported their house by
needlework, gave us an imaginary scene amid
a chancel with cowled heads, glimmering tapers,
and mysterious aisles, so the solitary in this
prose article leads us into the society of an old
<span id="pg_28" class="page_anchor">28 </span>uncle whose countenance resembles that of Cosmo
on the medallions of the Medici, who has been
crossed in love, and who wears a brocade vest
of faded damask, with large sprigs and roses.
The author thus proceeds in his description of
the imaginary uncle and the marvellous surroundings:—</p>

<p>“When my uncle beheld my childish admiration
for his venerable black-letter tome, he
fondly thought that he beheld the germ of an
antique genius already shooting out within my
mind, and from that day I became with him as
a favored wine. Time has been long on the
wing, and his affection for me grew in strength
as I in years; until at length he has bequeathed
to me the peculiar care of his library, which
consists of a multitude of huge old volumes and
some ancient and modern manuscripts. The
apartment which contains this treasure is the
cloister of my frequent and studious musings.
It is a curious little chamber, in a remote corner
of the house, finished all round with painted
panellings, and boasting but one tall, narrow
Venetian window, that lets in upon my studies
a ‘dim, religious light,’ which is quite appropriate
to them.</p>

<p>“Everything about that apartment is old
and decaying. The table, of oak inlaid with
maple, is worm-eaten and somewhat loose in the
<span id="pg_29" class="page_anchor">29 </span>joints; the chairs are massive and curiously
carved, but the sharper edges of the figures are
breaking away; and the solemn line of portraits
that cover the walls hang faded from black,
melancholy frames, and declare their intention
of soon leaving them forever. In a deep niche
stands a heavy iron clock that rings the hours
with hoarse and sullen voice; and opposite, in a
similar niche, is deposited a gloomy figure in
antique bronze. A recess, curtained with tapestry
of faded green, has become the cemetery of
departed genius, and, gathered in the embrace
of this little sepulchre, the works of good and
great men of ancient days are gradually mouldering
away to dust again.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_6" id="fnc_6">[6]</a></p>

<p>In view of this essentially artificial and even
boyish style, it is not strange that one of his
compositions should have been thus declined by
the eminently just and impartial editor of the
“North American Review,” Jared Sparks.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="salutation">Dear Sir</span>,—I return the article you were so
good as to send me. In many respects it has a
good deal of merit, but on the whole I do not
think it suited to the “Review.” Many of the
thoughts and reflections are good, but they want
maturity and betray a young writer. The style,
too, is a little ambitious, although not without
<span id="pg_30" class="page_anchor">30 </span>occasional elegance. With more practice the
author cannot fail to become a good writer; and
perhaps my judgment in regard to this article
would not agree with that of others whose opinion
is to be respected; but, after all, you know,
we editors have no other criterion than our own
judgment.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_7" id="fnc_7">[7]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless the young aspirant felt more and
more strongly drawn to a literary life, and this
found expression in his Commencement oration
on “Our Native Writers.” His brother and
biographer, writing of this address in later
years, says of it, “How interesting that [theme]
could be made in seven minutes the reader
may imagine,” and he does not even reprint it;
but it seems to me to be one of the most interesting
landmarks in the author’s early career, and
to point directly towards all that followed.</p>

<blockquote class="text">

<div class="title">
OUR NATIVE WRITERS
</div>

<p>To an American there is something endearing
in the very sound,—Our Native Writers.
Like the music of our native tongue, when heard
in a foreign land, they have power to kindle up
within him the tender memory of his home and
fireside; and more than this, they foretell that
whatever is noble and attractive in our national
<span id="pg_31" class="page_anchor">31 </span>character will one day be associated with the
sweet magic of Poetry. Is, then, our land to be
indeed the land of song? Will it one day be
rich in romantic associations? Will poetry, that
hallows every scene,—that renders every spot
classical,—and pours out on all things the soul
of its enthusiasm, breathe over it that enchantment,
which lives in the isles of Greece, and is
more than life amid the “woods, that wave o’er
Delphi’s steep”? Yes!—and palms are to be
won by our native writers!—by those that have
been nursed and brought up with us in the civil
and religious freedom of our country. Already
has a voice been lifted up in this land,—already
a spirit and a love of literature are springing
up in the shadow of our free political institutions.</p>

<p>But as yet we can boast of nothing farther
than a first beginning of a national literature:
a literature associated and linked in with the
grand and beautiful scenery of our country,—with
our institutions, our manners, our customs,—in
a word, with all that has helped to form
whatever there is peculiar to us, and to the land
in which we live. We cannot yet throw off our
literary allegiance to Old England, we cannot
yet remove from our shelves every book which
is not strictly and truly American. English literature
is a great and glorious monument, built
<span id="pg_32" class="page_anchor">32 </span>up by the master-spirits of old time, that had no
peers, and rising bright and beautiful until its
summit is hid in the mists of antiquity.</p>

<p>Of the many causes which have hitherto
retarded the growth of polite literature in our
country, I have not time to say much. The
greatest, which now exists, is doubtless the want
of that exclusive attention, which eminence in
any profession so imperiously demands. Ours
is an age and a country of great minds, though
perhaps not of great endeavors. Poetry with
us has never yet been anything but a pastime.
The fault, however, is not so much that of our
writers as of the prevalent modes of thinking
which characterize our country and our times.
We are a plain people, that have had nothing to
do with the mere pleasures and luxuries of life:
and hence there has sprung up within us a quick-sightedness
to the failings of literary men, and
an aversion to everything that is not practical,
operative, and thoroughgoing. But if we would
ever have a national literature, our native writers
must be patronized. Whatever there may
be in letters, over which time shall have no
power, must be “born of great endeavors,” and
those endeavors are the offspring of liberal patronage.
Putting off, then, what Shakespeare
calls “the visage of the times,”—we must become
hearty well-wishers to our native authors:—and
<span id="pg_33" class="page_anchor">33 </span>with them there must be a deep and
thorough conviction of the glory of their calling,—an
utter abandonment of everything
else,—and a noble self-devotion to the cause of
literature. We have indeed much to hope from
these things;—for our hearts are already growing
warm towards literary adventurers, and a
generous spirit has gone abroad in our land,
which shall liberalize and enlighten.</p>

<p>In the vanity of scholarship, England has
reproached us that we have no finished scholars.
But there is reason for believing that men of
mere learning—men of sober research and
studied correctness—do not give to a nation
its great name. Our very poverty in this respect
will have a tendency to give a national character
to our literature. Our writers will not be constantly
toiling and panting after classical allusions
to the Vale of Tempe and the Etrurian
river, nor to the Roman fountains shall—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“The emulous nations of the West repair</div>
<div class="line">To kindle their quenched urns, and drink fresh spirit there.”</div>
</div>

<p>We are thus thrown upon ourselves: and
thus shall our native hills become renowned in
song, like those of Greece and Italy. Every rock
shall become a chronicle of storied allusions;
and the tomb of the Indian prophet be as hallowed
as the sepulchres of ancient kings, or the
damp vault and perpetual lamp of the Saracen
monarch.</p>

<span id="pg_34" class="page_anchor">34 </span>

<p>Having briefly mentioned one circumstance
which is retarding us in the way of our literary
prosperity, I shall now mention one from which
we may hope a happy and glorious issue: It is
the influence of natural scenery in forming the
poetical character. Genius, to be sure, must be
born with a man; and it is its high prerogative
to be free, limitless, irrepressible. Yet how is it
moulded by the plastic hand of Nature! how
are its attributes shaped and modulated, when a
genius like Canova’s failed in the bust of the
Corsican, and amid the splendor of the French
metropolis languished for the sunny skies and
vine-clad hills of Italy? Men may talk of sitting
down in the calm and quiet of their libraries,
and of forgetting, in the eloquent companionship
of books, all the vain cares that beset
them in the crowded thoroughfares of life; but,
after all, there is nothing which so frees us from
the turbulent ambition and bustle of the world,
nothing which so fills the mind with great and
glowing conceptions, and at the same time so
warms the heart with love and tenderness, as
a frequent and close communion with natural
scenery. The scenery of our own country, too,
so rich as it is in everything beautiful and magnificent,
and so full of quiet loveliness or of sublime
and solitary awe, has for our eyes enchantment,
for our ears an impressive and unutterable
<span id="pg_35" class="page_anchor">35 </span>eloquence. Its language is in high mountains,
and in the pleasant valleys scooped out between
them, in the garniture which the fields put on,
and in the blue lake asleep in the hollow of the
hills. There is an inspiration, too, in the rich
sky that “brightens and purples” o’er our earth,
when lighted up with the splendor of morning,
or when the garment of the clouds comes over
the setting sun.</p>

<p>Our poetry is not in books alone. It is in
the hearts of those men, whose love for the
world’s gain,—for its business and its holiday,—has
grown cold within them, and who have
gone into the retirements of Nature, and have
found there that sweet sentiment and pure devotion
of feeling can spring up and live in the
shadow of a low and quiet life, and amid those
that have no splendor in their joys, and no parade
in their griefs.</p>

<p>Thus shall the mind take color from things
around us,—from them shall there be a genuine
birth of enthusiasm,—a rich development
of poetic feeling, that shall break forth in song.
Though the works of art must grow old and
perish away from earth, the forms of nature
shall keep forever their power over the human
mind, and have their influence upon the literature
of a people.</p>

<p>We may rejoice, then, in the hope of beauty
<span id="pg_36" class="page_anchor">36 </span>and sublimity in our national literature, for no
people are richer than we are in the treasures of
nature. And well may each of us feel a glorious
and high-minded pride in saying, as he looks on
the hills and vales,—on the woods and waters
of New England,—</p>

<span class="title">LITERATURE AS A PURSUIT</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Longfellow</span> graduated at Bowdoin College
in June, 1825. There was in his mind, apparently,
from the first, that definiteness of purpose
which is so often wanting when a student
takes his first college degree. There was for him
no doubt or hesitation: it must be literature or
nothing; and this not merely from a preference
for the pursuit, but from an ambition, willingly
acknowledged, to make a name in that direction.
He writes to his friend, George W. Wells,
“Somehow, and yet I hardly know why, I am
unwilling to study any profession. I cannot make
a lawyer of any eminence, because I have not a
talent for argument; I am not good enough for
a minister,—and as to physic, I utterly and
absolutely detest it.” Even a year before this,
he had written to his father a letter of some
moment, dated March 13, 1824, containing the
following ominous passage: “I am curious to
know what you do intend to make of me,—whether
I am to study a profession or not; and
if so, what profession. I hope your ideas upon
<span id="pg_38" class="page_anchor">38 </span>this subject will agree with mine, for I have a
particular and strong prejudice for one course
of life, to which you, I fear, will not agree. It
will not be worth while for me to mention what
this is until I become more acquainted with your
own wishes.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_9" id="fnc_9">[9]</a></p>

<p>This letter remaining for some months unanswered,
there followed another which at last
stated his own personal desire. It was written
to his father and dated December 5, 1824.</p>

<p>“I take this early opportunity to write to you,
because I wish to know fully your inclination
with regard to the profession I am to pursue
when I leave college.</p>

<p>“For my part I have already hinted to you
what would best please me. I want to spend
one year at Cambridge for the purpose of reading
history and of becoming familiar with the
best authors in polite literature; whilst at the
same time I can be acquiring a knowledge of the
Italian language, without an acquaintance with
which I shall be shut out from one of the most
beautiful departments of letters. The French I
mean to understand pretty thoroughly before I
leave college. After leaving Cambridge I would
attach myself to some literary periodical publication,
by which I could maintain myself and
still enjoy the advantages of reading. Now, I
<span id="pg_39" class="page_anchor">39 </span>do not think that there is anything visionary or
chimerical in my plan thus far. The fact is—and
I will not disguise it in the least, for I think
I ought not—the fact is, I most eagerly aspire
after future eminence in literature; my whole
soul burns most ardently for it, and every earthly
thought centres in it. There may be something
visionary in <em>this</em>, but I flatter myself that I have
prudence enough to keep my enthusiasm from
defeating its own object by too great haste.
Surely there never was a better opportunity offered
for the exertion of literary talent in our own
country than is now offered. To be sure, most
of our literary men thus far have not been professedly
so until they have studied and entered
the practice of Theology, Law, or Medicine.
But this is evidently lost time. I do believe
that we ought to pay more attention to the opinion
of philosophers, that ‘nothing but Nature
can qualify a man for knowledge.’</p>

<p>“Whether Nature has given me any capacity
for knowledge or not, she has at any rate given
me a very strong predilection for literary pursuits,
and I am almost confident in believing
that, if I can ever rise in the world, it must be
by the exercise of my talent in the wide field
of literature. With such a belief, I must say
that I am unwilling to engage in the study of
law.”</p>

<span id="pg_40" class="page_anchor">40 </span>

<p>Again on December 31 he writes to his father,
by way of New Year’s gift, “Let me reside one
year at Cambridge; let me study belles-lettres,
and after that time it will not require a spirit of
prophecy to predict with some degree of certainty
what kind of a figure I could make in
the literary world. If I fail here, there is still
time enough left for the study of a profession;
and while residing at Cambridge, I shall have
acquired the knowledge of some foreign languages
which will be, through life, of the greatest
utility.”</p>

<p>The answer of the father is too characteristic
to be omitted, whether for its views as to personal
standards or as to poetic structure. Most
youthful poets of that day had to face a critical
method based strictly upon the versification of
Pope, and their parents regarded all more flowing
measures as having a slight flavor of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>“The subject of your first letter is one of
deep interest and demands great consideration.
A literary life, to one who has the means of support,
must be very pleasant. But there is not
wealth enough in this country to afford encouragement
and patronage to merely literary men. And
as you have not had the fortune (I will not say
whether good or ill) to be born rich, you must
adopt a profession which will afford you subsistence
<span id="pg_41" class="page_anchor">41 </span>as well as reputation. I am happy to observe
that my ambition has never been to accumulate
wealth for my children, but to cultivate
their minds in the best possible manner, and to
imbue them with correct moral, political, and
religious principles,—believing that a person
thus educated will with proper diligence be certain
of attaining all the wealth which is necessary
to happiness. With regard to your spending
a year at Cambridge, I have always thought
it might be beneficial; and if my health should
not be impaired and my finances should allow, I
should be very happy to gratify you.... In
the ‘Advertiser’ of the 18th, I observe some
poetry from the ‘U. S. Literary Gazette,’ which
from the signature, I presume to be from your
pen. It is a very pretty production, and I read
it with pleasure. But you will observe that the
second line of the sixth verse has too many feet.
‘Beneath the dark and motionless beech.’ I
think it would be improved by substituting
<em>lonely</em> for <em>motionless</em>. I suggest this for your
consideration. I have the pleasure of hearing
frequently from home. They complain that they
have not heard a word from you since you left.
This is unpardonable.”</p>

<p>On January 24, 1825, the son wrote to his
father again:—</p>

<p>“From the general tenor of your last letter
<span id="pg_42" class="page_anchor">42 </span>it seems to be your fixed desire that I should
choose the profession of the law for the business
of my life. I am very much rejoiced that you
accede so readily to my proposition of studying
general literature for one year at Cambridge.
My grand object in doing this will be to gain as
perfect a knowledge of the French and Italian
languages as can be gained without travelling in
France and Italy,—though, to tell the truth, I
intend to visit both before I die.... I am afraid
you begin to think me rather chimerical in many
of my ideas, and that I am ambitious of becoming
a ‘<em>rara avis in terris</em>.’ But you must
acknowledge the usefulness of aiming high,—at
something which it is impossible to overshoot—perhaps
to reach. The fact is, I have a most
voracious appetite for knowledge. To its acquisition
I will sacrifice everything.... Nothing
delights me more than reading and writing.
And nothing could induce me to relinquish the
pleasures of literature, little as I have yet tasted
them. Of the three professions I should prefer
the law. I am far from being a fluent speaker,
but practice must serve as a talisman where
talent is wanting. I can be a lawyer. This
will support my real existence, literature an
<em>ideal</em> one.</p>

<p>“I purchased last evening a beautiful pocket
edition of Sir William Jones’s Letters, and have
<span id="pg_43" class="page_anchor">43 </span>just finished reading them. Eight languages he
was critically versed in; eight more he read
with a dictionary; and there were twelve more
not wholly unknown to him. I have somewhere
seen or heard the observation that as many languages
as a person acquires, so many times is he
a man.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_10" id="fnc_10">[10]</a></p>

<p>It was undoubtedly an important fact to the
young poet to be brought thus early in contact
with Sir William Jones and his twenty-eight
languages. It is the experience of all that the
gift of learning a variety of tongues is something
which peculiarly belongs to youth. In
Southern Europe, in Russia, in the East, it is a
common thing to encounter mere children who
with next to no schooling will prattle readily
in three or four languages with equal inaccuracy
but with equal ease; while a much older person
may acquire them by laborious study and yet
never feel at home. One can hardly doubt
Longfellow’s natural readiness in that direction;
he was always being complimented, at any
rate—though this may not count for much—upon
his aptness in pronouncing foreign tongues,
and the ease with which his own compositions
lent themselves to translation may very possibly
have some obscure connection with his own gifts
in this respect. His college training can have
<span id="pg_44" class="page_anchor">44 </span>had little bearing upon it, since there is no evidence
that his classmate Hawthorne, doubtless
a man of higher genius, showed any such capacity.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V<br>

<span class="title">FIRST VISIT TO EUROPE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Longfellow’s</span> college class (1825) numbered
thirty-seven, and his rank in it at graduation
was nominally fourth—though actually third,
through the sudden death of a classmate just before
Commencement. Soon after his graduation,
an opportunity occurred to establish a professorship
of modern languages in the college upon a
fund given by Mrs. Bowdoin; and he, being
then scarcely nineteen, and nominally a law
student in his father’s office, was sent to Europe
to prepare himself for this chair, apparently
on an allowance of six hundred dollars a year.
The college tradition is that this appointment—which
undoubtedly determined the literary tendencies
of his whole life—was given to him in
consequence of the impression made upon an
examining committee by the manner in which
he had translated one of Horace’s odes. He
accordingly sailed from New York for Europe
on May 15, 1826, having stopped at Boston
on the way, where he dined with Professor
George Ticknor, then holding the professorship
<span id="pg_46" class="page_anchor">46 </span>at Harvard College to which Longfellow was
destined to succeed at a later day. Professor
Ticknor had himself recently returned from a
German university, and urged the young man
to begin his studies there, giving him letters of
introduction to Professor Eichhorn, to Robert
Southey, and to Washington Irving, then in
Europe.</p>

<p>He sailed on the ship Cadmus, Captain Allen,
and wrote to his mother from Havre that his passage
of thirty days had been a dreary blank, and
that the voyage was very tiresome because of the
continual talking of French and broken English,
adding, “For Frenchmen, you know, talk incessantly,
and we had at least a dozen of them with
us.” In spite of this rather fatiguing opportunity,
he was not at once at home in French, but
wrote ere long, “I am coming on famously, I
assure you.” He wrote from Auteuil, where he
soon went, “Attached to the house is an extensive
garden, full of fruit-trees, and bowers, and
alcoves, where the boarders ramble and talk from
morning till night. This makes the situation an
excellent one for me; I can at any time hear
French conversation,—for the French are always
talking. Besides, the conversation is the
purest of French, inasmuch as persons from
the highest circles in Paris are residing here,—amongst
others, an old gentleman who was
<span id="pg_47" class="page_anchor">47 </span>of the household of Louis the Sixteenth, and a
Madame de Sailly, daughter of a celebrated
advocate named Berryer, who was the defender
of Marshal Ney in his impeachment for treason.
There is also a young student of law here, who
is my almost constant companion, and who corrects
all my mistakes in speaking or writing the
French. As he is not much older than I am, I
do not feel so much embarrassed in speaking to
him as I do in speaking to others. These are
some of the advantages which I enjoy here, and
you can easily imagine others which a country
residence offers over that of a city, during the
vacation of the literary institutions at Paris and
the cessation of their lectures.”</p>

<p>It is to be noticed from the outset that the
French villages disappointed him as they disappoint
many others. In his letters he recalls
“how fresh and cheerful and breezy a New England
village is; how marked its features—so <ins title="Note: “diferent” in the original">different</ins>
from the town, so peculiar, so delightful.”
He finds a French village, on the other hand, to be
like a deserted town, having “the same paved
streets, the same dark, narrow alleys without
sidewalks, the same dingy stone houses, each
peeping into its neighbor’s windows, the same
eternal stone walls, shutting in from the eye of
the stranger all the beauty of the place and
opposing an inhospitable barrier to the lover
<span id="pg_48" class="page_anchor">48 </span>of natural scenery.” But when he finds himself
among rural scenes, he has the delight felt
by many an American boy since his days, as
in the picture following:—</p>

<p>“From Orléans I started on foot for Tours
on the fifth of October. October is my favorite
month of the twelve. When I reflected that if I
remained in Paris I should lose the only opportunity
I might ever enjoy of seeing the centre of
France in all the glory of the vintage and the
autumn, I ‘shut the book-lid’ and took wing,
with a little knapsack on my back, and a blue
cap,—not exactly like Quentin Durward, but
perhaps a little more. More anon of him. I had
gone as far as Orléans in the <em>diligence</em> because
the route is through an uninteresting country.</p>

<p>“I began the pedestrian part of my journey
on one of those dull, melancholy days which
you will find uttering a mournful voice in
Sewall’s Almanack: ‘Expect—much—rain—about—this—time!’
‘Very miscellaneous
weather, good for sundry purposes,’—but not
for a journey on foot, thought I. But I had a
merry heart, and it went merrily along all day.
At sundown I found myself about seven leagues
on my way and one beyond Beaugency. I found
the route one continued vineyard. On each side
of the road, as far as the eye could reach, there
was nothing but vines, save here and there a
<span id="pg_49" class="page_anchor">49 </span>glimpse of the Loire, the turrets of an old château,
or spire of a village church. The clouds
had passed away with the morning, and I had
made a fine day’s journey, cutting across the
country, traversing vineyards, and living in all
the luxury of thought which the occasion inspired.
I recollect that at sunset I had entered
a path which wound through a wide vineyard
where the villagers were still at their labors,
and I was loitering along, talking with the
peasantry and searching for an <em>auberge</em> to pass
the night in. I was presently overtaken by a
band of villagers; I wished them a good evening,
and finding that the girls of the party were
going to a village at a short distance, I joined
myself to the band. I wanted to get into one
of the cottages, if possible, in order to study character.
I had a flute in my knapsack, and I
thought it would be very pretty to touch up at a
cottage door, Goldsmith-like,—though I would
not have done it for the world without an invitation.
Well, before long, I determined to get an
invitation, if possible. So I addressed the girl
who was walking beside me, told her I had a
flute in my sack, and asked her if she would like
to dance. Now laugh long and loud! What do
you suppose her answer was? She said she liked
to dance, but she did not know what a flute was!
What havoc that made among my romantic
<span id="pg_50" class="page_anchor">50 </span>ideas! My <em>quietus</em> was made; I said no more
about a flute, the whole journey through; and I
thought nothing but starvation would drive me
to strike up at the entrance of a village, as
Goldsmith did.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_11" id="fnc_11">[11]</a></p>

<p>Thus, wherever he goes, his natural good spirits
prevail over everything. Washington Irving,
in his diary, speaks of Longfellow at Madrid as
having “arrived safely and cheerily, having met
with no robbers.” Mrs. Alexander Everett,
wife of the American minister at Madrid, writes
back to America, “His countenance is itself a
letter of recommendation.” He went into good
Spanish society and also danced in the streets
on village holidays. At the Alhambra, he saw
the refinement of beauty within the halls, and
the clusters of gypsy caves in the hillside opposite.
After eight months of Spain he went on
to Italy, where he remained until December, and
passed to Germany with the new year. He sums
up his knowledge of the languages at this point
by saying, “With the French and Spanish languages
I am familiarly conversant so as to speak
them correctly and write them with as much
ease and fluency as I do the English. The
Portuguese I read without difficulty. And with
regard to my proficiency in the Italian, I have
only to say that all at the hotel where I lodge
<span id="pg_51" class="page_anchor">51 </span>took me for an Italian, until I told them I was
an American.” He settled down to his studies
in Germany, his father having written, with
foresight then unusual, “I consider the German
language and literature much more important
than the Italian.” He did not, however, have
any sense of actual transplantation, as is the
case with some young students, for although he
writes to his sister (March 28, 1829), “My
poetic career is finished. Since I left America
I have hardly put two lines together,” yet he
sends to Carey &amp; Lea, the Philadelphia publishers,
to propose a series of sketches and tales
of New England life. These sketches, as given
in his note-book, are as follows:—</p>

<p>“1. New England Scenery: description of
Sebago Pond; rafting logs; tavern scene; a
tale connected with the ‘Images.’</p>

<p>“2. A New England Village: country squire;
the parson; the little deacon; the farm-house
kitchen.</p>

<p>“3. Husking Frolic: song and tales; fellow
who plays the fife for the dance; tale of the
Quoddy Indians; description of Sacobezon, their
chief.</p>

<p>“5. Thanksgiving Day: its merry-making,
and tales (also of the Indians).</p>

<p>“7. Description of the White Mountains:
tale of the Bloody Hand.</p>

<span id="pg_52" class="page_anchor">52 </span>

<p>“10. Reception of Lafayette in a country
village.</p>

<p>“13. Down East: the missionary of Acadie.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_12" id="fnc_12">[12]</a></p>

<p>A few days after, he wrote from Göttingen to
his father, “I shall never again be in Europe.”
We thus see his mind at work on American
themes in Germany, as later on German themes
in America, unconsciously predicting that mingling
of the two influences which gave him his
fame. His earlier books gave to studious Americans,
as I can well recall, their first imaginative
glimpses of Europe, while the poet’s homeward-looking
thoughts from Europe had shown the
instinct which was to identify his later fame
with purely American themes. It is to be noticed
that whatever was artificial and foreign in
Longfellow’s work appeared before he went to
Europe; and was the same sort of thing which
appeared in all boyish American work at that
period. It was then that in describing the Indian
hunter he made the dance go round by the greenwood
tree. He did not lay this aside at once
after his return from Europe, and Margaret
Fuller said of him, “He borrows incessantly and
mixes what he borrows.” Criticising the very
prelude to “Voices of the Night,” she pointed
out the phrases “pentecost” and “bishop’s-caps”
as indications that he was not merely “musing
<span id="pg_53" class="page_anchor">53 </span>upon many things,” but on many books which
described them. But the habit steadily diminished.
His very gift at translation, in which he
probably exceeded on the whole any other modern
poet, led him, nevertheless, always to reproduce
old forms rather than create new ones, thus aiding
immensely his popularity with the mass of
simple readers, while coming short of the full
demands of the more critical. To construct his
most difficult poems was thus mainly a serene
pleasure, and something as far as possible from
that conflict which kept Hawthorne all winter,
by his wife’s testimony, with “a knot in his
forehead” while he was writing “The Scarlet
Letter.”</p>

<p>It is always to be borne in mind that, as
Mr. Scudder has pointed out in his admirable
paper on “Longfellow and his Art,” the young
poet was really preparing himself in Europe
for his literary work as well as for his professional
work, and half consciously. This is singularly
confirmed by his lifelong friend, Professor
George W. Greene, who, in dedicating his
“The Life of Nathanael Greene” to his friend,
thus recalls an evening spent together at Naples
in 1828:—</p>

<p>“We wanted,” he says, “to be alone, and yet
to feel that there was life all around us. We
went up to the flat roof of the house where, as
<span id="pg_54" class="page_anchor">54 </span>we walked, we could look down into the crowded
street, and out upon the wonderful bay, and
across the bay to Ischia and Capri and Sorrento,
and over the house-tops and villas and vineyards
to Vesuvius. The ominous pillar of smoke hung
suspended above the fatal mountain, reminding
us of Pliny, its first and noblest victim. A golden
vapor crowned the bold promontory of Sorrento,
and we thought of Tasso. Capri was calmly
sleeping, like a sea-bird upon the waters; and
we seemed to hear the voice of Tacitus from
across the gulf of eighteen centuries, telling us
that the historian’s pen is still powerful to absolve
or to condemn long after the imperial sceptre
has fallen from the withered hand. There,
too, lay the native island of him whose daring
mind conceived the fearful vengeance of the
Sicilian Vespers. We did not yet know Niccolini;
but his grand verses had already begun
their work of regeneration in the Italian heart.
Virgil’s tomb was not far off. The spot consecrated
by Sannazaro’s ashes was near us. And
over all, with a thrill like that of solemn music,
fell the splendor of the Italian sunset.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_13" id="fnc_13">[13]</a></p>

<p>As an illustration of this obvious fact that
Longfellow, during this first European visit,
while nominally training himself for purely
educational work, was fitting himself also for a
<span id="pg_55" class="page_anchor">55 </span>literary career, we find from his letter to his
father, May 15, 1829, that while hearing lectures
in German and studying faithfully that
language, he was, as he says, “writing a book, a
kind of Sketch-Book of scenes in France, Spain,
and Italy.” We shall presently encounter this
book under the name of “Outre-Mer.” He
connects his two aims by saying in the same
letter, “One must write and write correctly, in
order to teach.” Again he adds, “The further
I advance, the more I see to be done. The
more, too, I am persuaded of the charlatanism
of literary men. For the rest, my fervent wish
is to return home.” His brother tells us that
among his note-books of that period, we find a
favorite passage from Locke which reappears
many years after in one of his letters and in his
impromptu address to the children of Cambridge,
in 1880: “Thus the ideas as well as
the children of our youth often die before us,
and our minds represent to us those tombs to
which we are approaching; where, though the
brass and marble remain, yet the inscriptions
are effaced by time, and the imagery moulders
away.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_14" id="fnc_14">[14]</a> He also included a quotation from
John Lyly’s “Endymion,” which ten years later
furnished the opening of his own “Hyperion.”
<span id="pg_56" class="page_anchor">56 </span>“Dost thou know what a poet is? Why, fool,
a poet is as much as one should say—a poet.”
When we consider what he had just before
written to his sister, it only furnishes another
illustration of the fact, which needs no demonstration,
that young authors do not always know
themselves.</p>

<p>He reached home from Europe, after three
years of absence, on August 11, 1829, looking
toward Bowdoin College as his abode, and a
professorship of modern languages as his future
position. Up to this time, to be sure, the economical
college had offered him only an instructorship.
But he had shown at this point that
quiet decision and firmness which marked him
in all practical affairs, and which was not always
quite approved by his more anxious father. In
this case he carried his point, and he received
on the 6th of September this simple record of
proceedings from the college:—</p>

<p>“In the Board of Trustees of Bowdoin College,
Sept. 1st, 1829: Mr. Henry W. Longfellow
having declined to accept the office of
instructor in modern languages.</p>

<p>“Voted, that we now proceed to the choice of
a professor of modern languages.</p>

<p>“And Mr. H. W. Longfellow was chosen.”</p>

<p>Thus briefly was the matter settled, and he
was launched upon his life’s career at the age of
<span id="pg_57" class="page_anchor">57 </span>twenty-two. Of those who made up his circle
of friends in later years, Holmes had just graduated
from Harvard, Sumner was a Senior
there, and Lowell was a schoolboy in Cambridge.
Few American colleges had at that
time special professors of modern languages,
though George Ticknor had set a standard for
them all. Longfellow had to prepare his own
text-books—to translate “L’Homond’s Grammar,”
to edit an excellent little volume of
French “Proverbes Dramatiques,” and a small
Spanish Reader, “Novelas Españolas.” He was
also enlisted in a few matters outside, and drew
up the outline of a prospectus for a girls’ high
school in Portland, such high schools being then
almost as rare as professorships of modern languages.
He was also librarian. He gave a
course of lectures on French, Spanish, and Italian
literature, but there seems to have been no
reference to German, which had not then come
forward into the place in American education
which it now occupies. As to literature, he
wrote to his friend, George W. Greene, “Since
my return I have written one piece of poetry,
but have not published a line. You need not
be alarmed on that score. I am all prudence
now, since I can form a more accurate judgment
of the merit of poetry. If I ever publish
a volume, it will be many years first.” It was
<span id="pg_58" class="page_anchor">58 </span>actually nine years. For the “North American
Review” he wrote in April, 1831, an essay
on “The Origin and Progress of the French
Language.” He afterwards sent similar papers
to the same periodical upon the Italian and
Spanish languages and literatures, each of these
containing also original translations. Thus he
entered on his career as a teacher, but another
change in life also awaited him.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI<br>

<span class="title">MARRIAGE AND LIFE AT BRUNSWICK</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">It</span> has been a source of regret to many that
the memoirs of Longfellow, even when prepared
by his brother, have given, perhaps necessarily,
so little space to his early love and first marriage,
facts which are apt to be, for a poet, the
turning-points in his career. We know that
this period in Lowell’s life, for instance, brought
what seemed almost a transformation of his nature,
making an earnest reformer and patriot of
a youth who had hitherto been little more than
a brilliant and somewhat reckless boy. In Longfellow’s
serener nature there was no room for a
change so marked, yet it is important to recognize
that it brought with it a revival of that
poetic tendency which had singularly subsided
for a time after its early manifestation. He
had written to his friend, George W. Greene,
on June 27, 1830, that he had long ceased to
attach any value to his early poems or even to
think of them at all. Yet after about a year of
married life, he began (December 1, 1832) the
introduction to his Phi Beta Kappa poem, and
<span id="pg_60" class="page_anchor">60 </span>during the following year published a volume of
poetical translations from the Spanish; thus imitating
Bryant, then in some ways his model, who
had derived so much of his inspiration from the
Spanish muse. It is not unreasonable to recognize
something of his young wife’s influence in
this rekindling of poetic impulse, and it is pleasant,
in examining the manuscript lectures delivered
by him at Bowdoin College and still preserved
there, to find them accompanied by pages
of extracts, here and there, in her handwriting.
It will therefore be interesting to make her
acquaintance a little farther.</p>

<p>Mary Storer Potter was the second daughter
of the Hon. Barrett Potter and Anne (Storer)
Potter of Portland, neighbors and friends of the
Longfellow family. She had been for a time
a schoolmate of Henry Longfellow at the private
school of Bezaleel Cushman in Portland;
and it is the family tradition that on the young
professor’s returning to his native city after his
three years’ absence in Europe he saw her at
church and was so struck with her appearance
as to follow her home afterwards without venturing
to accost her. On reaching his own house,
however, he begged his sister to call with him
at once at the Potter residence, and all the rest
followed as in a novel. They were married
September 14, 1831, she being then nineteen
<span id="pg_61" class="page_anchor">61 </span>years of age, having been born on May 12,
1812, and he being twenty-four.</p>

<p>It was a period when Portland was somewhat
celebrated for the beauty of its women; and indeed
feminine beauty, at least in regard to coloring,
seems somewhat developed, like the tints of
garden flowers, by the neighborhood of the sea.
An oil painting of Mrs. Longfellow is in my
possession, taken in a costume said to have been
selected by the young poet from one of the highly
illustrated annuals so much in vogue at that day.
She had dark hair and deep blue eyes, the latter
still represented in some of her nieces, although
she left no children. Something of her love of
study and of her qualities of mind and heart
are also thus represented in this younger generation.
She had never learned Latin or Greek,
her father disapproving of those studies for
girls, but he had encouraged her in the love of
mathematics, and there is among her papers a
calculation of an eclipse.</p>

<p>She had been mainly educated at the school,
then celebrated, of Miss Gushing in Hingham.
“My first impression of her,” wrote in later years
the venerable professor, Alpheus Packard,—who
was professor of Latin and Greek at Bowdoin
at the time of her marriage,—“is of an attractive
person, blooming in health and beauty, the
graceful bride of a very attractive and elegant
<span id="pg_62" class="page_anchor">62 </span>young man.” Some books from her girlish
library now lie before me, dingy and time-worn,
with her name in varying handwriting from the
early “Mary S. Potter” to the later “Mary
S. P. Longfellow.” They show many marked
passages and here and there a quotation. The
collection begins with Miss Edgeworth’s “Harry
and Lucy;” then follow somewhat abruptly
“Sabbath Recreations,” by Miss Emily Taylor,
and “The Wreath, a selection of elegant poems
from the best authors,”—these poems including
the classics of that day, Beattie’s “Minstrel,”
Blair’s “Grave,” Gray’s “Elegy,” Goldsmith’s
“Traveller,” and some lighter measures from
Campbell, Moore, and Burns. The sombre muse
undoubtedly predominated, but on the whole
the book was not so bad an elementary preparation
for the training of a poet’s wife. It is a
touching accidental coincidence that one of the
poems most emphatically marked is one of the
few American poems in these volumes, Bryant’s
“Death of the Flowers,” especially the last
verse, which describes a woman who died in her
youthful beauty. To these are added books of
maturer counsel, as Miss Bowdler’s “Poems
and Essays,” then reprinted from the sixteenth
English edition, but now forgotten, and Mrs.
Barbauld’s “Legacy for Young Ladies,” discussing
beauty, fashion, botany, the uses of
<span id="pg_63" class="page_anchor">63 </span>history, and especially including a somewhat
elaborate essay on “female studies,” on which,
perhaps, Judge Potter founded his prohibition
of the classics. Mrs. Barbauld lays down the
rule that “the learned languages, the Greek
especially, require a great deal more time than
a young woman can conveniently spare. To
the Latin,” she adds, “there is not an equal
objection ... and it will not,” she thinks, “in
the present state of things, excite either a smile
or a stare in fashionable company.” But she
afterwards says, “French you are not only permitted
to learn, but you are laid under the
same necessity of acquiring it as your brother
is of acquiring the Latin.” Mrs. Barbauld’s
demands, however, are not extravagant, as she
thinks that “a young person who reads French
with ease, who is so well grounded as to write
it grammatically, and has what I should call a
good English pronunciation will by a short
residence in France gain fluency and the
accent.” This “good English pronunciation”
of French is still not unfamiliar to those acquainted
with Anglicized or Americanized regions
of Paris.</p>

<p>Among the maturer books of Mary Potter
was Worcester’s “Elements of History,” then
and now a clear and useful manual of its kind,
and a little book called “The Literary Gem”
<span id="pg_64" class="page_anchor">64 </span>(1827), which was an excellent companion or
antidote for Worcester’s History, as it included
translations from the German imaginative
writers just beginning to be known, Goethe,
Richter, and Körner, together with examples of
that American literary school which grew up
partly in imitation of the German, and of which
the “Legend of Peter Rugg,” by William
Austin, is the only specimen now remembered.
With this as a concluding volume, it will be
seen that Mary Potter’s mind had some fitting
preparation for her husband’s companionship,
and that the influence of Bryant in poetry, and
of Austin, the precursor of Hawthorne, in prose,
may well have lodged in her mind the ambition,
which was always making itself visible in her
husband, towards the new work of creating an
American literature. It is in this point of view
that the young wife’s mental training assumed
a real importance in studying the atmosphere
of Longfellow’s early days. For the rest, she
was described by her next-door neighbor in
Brunswick, Miss Emeline Weld, as “a lovely
woman in character and appearance, gentle, refined,
and graceful, with an attractive manner
that won all hearts.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_15" id="fnc_15">[15]</a></p>

<p>Longfellow’s salary at Bowdoin College was
eight hundred dollars, as professor of modern
<span id="pg_65" class="page_anchor">65 </span>languages, with an additional hundred as librarian.
From the beginning he took the lead
among American teachers in this department,
the difficulty among these being that they consisted
of two classes,—Americans imperfectly
acquainted with Europe and foreigners as imperfectly
known in America. Even in the selection
of mere tutors the same trouble always
existed, though partially diminished, as time
went on, by those refugees from revolutionary
excitements in Europe, especially from Germany
and Italy, who were a real addition to our university
circles. Even these were from their very
conditions of arrival a somewhat impetuous and
unmanageable class, and in American colleges—as
later during the Civil War in the American
army—the very circumstances of their
training made them sometimes hard to control
as subordinates. It was very fortunate, when
they found, as in Longfellow, a well-trained
American who could be placed over their heads.</p>

<p>There were also text-books and readers to
be prepared and edited by the young professor,
one of which, as I well remember, was
of immense value to students, the “Proverbes
Dramatiques,” already mentioned, a collection
of simple and readable plays, written in colloquial
French, and a most valuable substitute
for the previous Racine and Corneille, the use
<span id="pg_66" class="page_anchor">66 </span>of which was like teaching classes to read out
of Shakespeare. Thus full of simple and congenial
work, Longfellow went to housekeeping
with his young wife in a house still attractive
under its rural elms, and thus described by
him:—</p>

<p>“June 23 [1831]. I can almost fancy myself
in Spain, the morning is so soft and beautiful.
The tessellated shadow of the honeysuckle lies
motionless upon my study floor, as if it were a
figure in the carpet; and through the open window
comes the fragrance of the wild brier and
the mock orange. The birds are carolling in
the trees, and their shadows flit across the window
as they dart to and fro in the sunshine;
while the murmur of the bee, the cooing of
doves from the eaves, and the whirring of a
little humming-bird that has its nest in the
honeysuckle, send up a sound of joy to meet the
rising sun.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7">CHAPTER VII<br>

<span class="title">THE CORNER STONE LAID</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">That</span> the young professor rose very early for
literary work, even in November, we know by
his own letters, and we also know that he then
as always took this work very seriously and earnestly.
What his favorite employment was, we
learn by a letter to his friend George W. Greene
(March 9, 1833) about a book which he proposes
to publish in parts, and concerning which he
adds, “I find that it requires little courage to
publish grammars and school-books; but in the
department of fine writing—or attempts at fine
writing—it requires vastly more.” As a matter
of fact, he had already published preliminary
sketches of “Outre-Mer” in the “New England
Magazine,” a Boston periodical just undertaken,
putting them under the rather inappropriate title
of “The Schoolmaster,” the first appearing in the
number for July 18, 1831,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_16" id="fnc_16">[16]</a> and the sixth and last
in the number for February, 1833.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_17" id="fnc_17">[17]</a> He writes
to his sister (July 17, 1831), “I hereby send you
<span id="pg_68" class="page_anchor">68 </span>a magazine for your amusement. I wrote ‘The
Schoolmaster’ and the translation from Luis
de <ins title="Note: “Gorgora” in the original">Gongora</ins>.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_18" id="fnc_18">[18]</a> It is worth mentioning that he
adds, “Read ‘The Late Joseph Natterstrom.’ It
is good.” This was a story by William Austin,
whose “Peter Rugg, the Missing Man,” has just
been mentioned as an early landmark of the
period.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_19" id="fnc_19">[19]</a> It is fair to say, however, that the
critic of to-day can hardly see in these youthful
pages any promise of the Longfellow of the
future. The opening chapter, describing the
author as a country schoolmaster, who plays with
his boys in the afternoon, is only a bit of Irving
diluted,—the later papers, “A Walk in Normandy,”
“The Village of Auteuil,” etc., carrying
the thing somewhat farther, but always in
the same rather thin vein. Their quality of
crudeness was altogether characteristic of the
period, and although Holmes and Whittier tried
their ’prentice hands with the best intentions
in the same number of the “New England
Magazine,” they could not raise its level. We
see in these compositions, as in the “Annuals”
of that day, that although Hawthorne had begun
with his style already formed, yet that of
Longfellow was still immature. This remark
does not, indeed, apply to a version of a French
<span id="pg_69" class="page_anchor">69 </span>drinking song,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_20" id="fnc_20">[20]</a> which exhibits something of his
later knack at such renderings. There was at
any rate some distinct maturity in the first number
of “Outre-Mer,” which appeared in 1835.
A notice of this book in the London “Spectator”
closed with this expression of judgment:
“Either the author of the ‘Sketch Book’ has
received a warning, or there are two Richmonds
in the field.”</p>

<p>Literary history hardly affords a better instance
of the direct following of a model by a
younger author than one can inspect by laying
side by side a page of the first number of
“Outre-Mer” and a page of the “Sketch Book,”
taking in each case the first American editions.
Irving’s books were printed by C. S. Van Winkle,
New York, and Longfellow’s by J. Griffin,
Brunswick, Maine; the latter bearing the imprint
of Hilliard, Gray &amp; Co., Boston, and the
former of the printer only. Yet the physical appearance
of the two sets of books is almost identical;
the typography, distribution into chapters,
the interleaved titles of these chapters, and the
prefix to each chapter of a little motto, often in a
foreign language. It must be remembered that
the “Sketch Book,” like “Outre-Mer,” was originally
published in numbers; and besides all this
the literary style of Longfellow’s work was at this
<span id="pg_70" class="page_anchor">70 </span>time so much like that of Irving that it is very
hard at first to convince the eye that Irving is not
responsible for all. Yet for some reason or other
the early copies of the “Sketch Book” command
no high price at auction, while at the recent sale
of Mr. Arnold’s collection in New York the two
parts of “Outre-Mer” brought $310. The work
is now so rare that the library of Harvard
University has no copy of the second part, and
only an imperfect copy of the first with several
pages mutilated, but originally presented
to Professor Felton by the author and bearing
his autograph. As to style, it is unquestionable
that in “Outre-Mer” we find Washington Irving
frankly reproduced, while in “Hyperion” we
are soon to see the development of a new literary
ambition and of a more imaginative touch.</p>

<p>The early notices of “Outre-Mer” are written
in real or assumed ignorance of the author’s
name and almost always with some reference to
Irving. Thus there is a paper in the “North
American Review” for October, 1834, by the
Rev. O. W. B. Peabody, who says of the book that
it is “obviously the production of a writer of talent
and of cultivated taste, who has chosen to give
to the public the results of his observation in
foreign countries in the form of a series of tales
and sketches.” He continues, “It is a form
which, as every reader knows, had been recommended
<span id="pg_71" class="page_anchor">71 </span>by the high example and success of Mr.
Irving.... It is not to be supposed that in
adopting the form of Mr. Irving, the author has
been guilty of any other imitation.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_21" id="fnc_21">[21]</a> This may
in some sense be true, and yet it is impossible to
compare the two books without seeing that kind
of assimilation which is only made more thorough
by being unconscious. Longfellow, even
thus early, brought out more picturesquely and
vividly than Irving the charm exerted by the
continent of Europe over the few Americans
who were exploring it. What Irving did in this
respect for England, Longfellow did for the continental
nations. None of the first German students
from America, Ticknor, Cogswell, Everett,
or Bancroft, had been of imaginative temperament,
and although their letters, as since printed,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_22" id="fnc_22">[22]</a>
revealed Germany to America as the land of
learning, it yet remained for Longfellow to portray
all Europe from the point of view of the
pilgrim. When he went to England in 1835, as
we shall see, he carried with him for English
publication the two volumes of one of the earliest
literary tributes paid by the New World to
the Old, “Outre-Mer.”</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that Mr. Samuel Longfellow,
in his admirable memoir of his brother,
<span id="pg_72" class="page_anchor">72 </span>omits all attempt to identify the stories by the
latter which are mentioned as appearing in the
annual called “The Token,” published in Boston
and edited by S. G. Goodrich. This annual was
the first of a series undertaken in America, on
the plan of similar volumes published under many
names in England. It has a permanent value
for literary historians in this country as containing
many of Hawthorne’s “Twice-Told Tales”
in their original form, but often left anonymous,
and sometimes signed only by his initial
(H.). In the list of his own early publications
given by Longfellow to George W. Greene under
date of March 9, 1833, he includes, “7. In ‘The
Token’ for 1832, a story.... 8. In the same, for
1833, a story.” To identify the contributions
thus affords a curious literary puzzle. The first
named volume—“The Token” for 1832—contains
the tale of a domestic bereavement under
the name of “The Indian Summer;” this has
for a motto a passage from “The Maid’s Tragedy,”
and the whole story is signed with the
initial “L.” This would seem naturally to suggest
Longfellow, and is indeed almost conclusive.
Yet curiously enough there is in the same volume
a short poem called “La Doncella,” translated
from the Spanish and signed “L....,” which
is quite in the line of the Spanish versions he
was then writing, although not included in Mr.
<span id="pg_73" class="page_anchor">73 </span>Scudder’s list of his juvenile or unacknowledged
poems. To complicate the matter still farther,
there is also a story called “David Whicher,”
dated Bowdoin College, June 1, 1831, this being
a period when Longfellow was at work there,
and yet this story is wholly remote in style from
“The Indian Summer,” being a rather rough and
vernacular woodman’s tale. Of the two, “The
Indian Summer” seems altogether the more
likely to be his work, and indeed bears a distinct
likeness to the equally tragic tale of “Jacqueline”
in “Outre-Mer,”—the one describing
the funeral of a young girl in America, the
other in Europe, both of them having been suggested,
possibly, by the recent death of his own
sister.</p>

<p>In the second volume of “The Token” (1833)
the puzzle is yet greater, for though there are
half a dozen stories without initials, or other
clue to authorship, yet not one of them suggests
Longfellow at all, or affords the slightest clue by
which it can be connected with him, while on the
other hand there is a poem occupying three pages
and signed H. W. L., called “An Evening in Autumn.”
This was never included by him among
his works, nor does it appear in the list of his juvenile
poems and translations in the Appendix to
Mr. Scudder’s edition of his “Complete Poetical
Works,” yet the initials leave hardly a doubt
<span id="pg_74" class="page_anchor">74 </span>that it was written by him. Why, then, was it
not mentioned in this list sent to Mr. George W.
Greene, or did he by a slip of the pen record it
as a story and not as a poem? Perhaps no solution
of this conundrum will ever be given, but
it would form a valuable contribution to the
record of his literary dawning. Judging from
the evidence now given, the most probable hypothesis
would seem to be that the two contributions
which Longfellow meant to enumerate
were the story called “An Indian Summer” in
“The Token” for 1832, and a poem, not a story,
in “The Token” for 1833. Even against this
theory there is the objection to be made that the
editor of “The Token,” Samuel G. Goodrich, in
his “Recollections of a Lifetime” (New York,
1856), after mentioning Longfellow casually, at
the very end of his list of writers, says of him,
“It is a curious fact that the latter, Longfellow,
wrote prose, and at that period had shown neither
a strong bias nor a particular talent for poetry.”
It is farther noticeable that in his index to this
book, Mr. Goodrich does not find room for Longfellow’s
name at all.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_23" id="fnc_23">[23]</a></p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that at the very time
when Longfellow was writing these somewhat
trivial contributions for “The Token,” he was
also engaged on an extended article for “The
<span id="pg_75" class="page_anchor">75 </span>North American Review,” which was a great
advance upon all that he had before published.
His previous papers had all been scholarly,
but essentially academic. They had all lain
in the same general direction with Ticknor’s
“History of Spanish Literature,” and had
shared its dryness. But when he wrote, at
twenty-four, an article for “The North American
Review” of January, 1832,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_24" id="fnc_24">[24]</a> called “The Defence
of Poetry,” taking for his theme Sir Philip
Sidney’s “Defence of Poesy,” just then republished
in the “Library of the Old English Prose
Writers,” at Cambridge, Mass., it was in a manner
a prediction of Emerson’s oration, “The
American Scholar,” five years later. So truly
stated were his premises that they are still valid
and most important for consideration to-day,
after seventy years have passed. It is thus that
his appeal begins:—</p>

<p>... “With us, the spirit of the age is clamorous
for utility,—for visible, tangible utility,—for
bare, brawny, muscular utility. We would
be roused to action by the voice of the populace,
and the sounds of the crowded mart, and not
‘lulled to sleep in shady idleness with poet’s
pastimes.’ We are swallowed up in schemes
for gain, and engrossed with contrivances for
bodily enjoyments, as if this particle of dust
<span id="pg_76" class="page_anchor">76 </span>were immortal,—as if the soul needed no aliment,
and the mind no raiment. We glory in
the extent of our territory, in our rapidly increasing
population, in our agricultural privileges,
and our commercial advantages.... We
boast of the increase and extent of our physical
strength, the sound of populous cities, breaking
the silence and solitude of our Western territories,—plantations
conquered from the forest,
and gardens springing up in the wilderness.
Yet the true glory of a nation consists not in
the extent of its territory, the pomp of its forests,
the majesty of its rivers, the height of its
mountains and the beauty of its sky; but in the
extent of its mental power,—the majesty of its
intellect,—the height and depth and purity of
its moral nature.... True greatness is the
greatness of the mind;—the true glory of a
nation is moral and intellectual preëminence.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_25" id="fnc_25">[25]</a></p>

<p>“Not he alone,” the poet boldly goes on,
“does service to the State, whose wisdom guides
her councils at home, nor he whose voice asserts
her dignity abroad. A thousand little rills,
springing up in the retired walks of life, go to
swell the rushing tide of national glory and prosperity;
and whoever in the solitude of his chamber,
and by even a single effort of his mind, has
added to the intellectual preëminence of his
<span id="pg_77" class="page_anchor">77 </span>country, has not lived in vain, nor to himself
alone.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_26" id="fnc_26">[26]</a></p>

<p>He goes on to argue, perhaps needlessly, in
vindication of poetry for its own sake and for
the way in which it combines itself with the history
of the nation, and expresses the spirit of
that nation. He then proceeds to a direct appeal
in behalf of that very spirit. Addressing the
poets of America he says, “To those of them
who may honor us by reading our article, we
would whisper this request,—that they should
be more original, and withal more national. It
seems every way important, that now, whilst we
are forming our literature, we should make it as
original, characteristic, and national as possible.
To effect this, it is not necessary that the war-whoop
should ring in every line, and every page
be rife with scalps, tomahawks, and wampum.
Shade of Tecumseh forbid!—The whole secret
lies in Sidney’s maxim,—‘Look in thy heart
and write.’”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_27" id="fnc_27">[27]</a></p>

<p>He then points out that while a national
literature strictly includes “every mental effort
made by the inhabitants of a country through
the medium of the press,” yet no literature can
be national in the highest sense unless it “bears
upon it the stamp of national character.” This
he illustrates by calling attention to certain local
<span id="pg_78" class="page_anchor">78 </span>peculiarities of English poetry as compared with
that of the southern nations of Europe. He
gives examples to show that the English poets
excel their rivals in their descriptions of morning
and evening, this being due, he thinks, to
their longer twilights in both directions. On the
other hand, the greater dreaminess and more
abundant figurative language of southern nations
are qualities which he attributes to their
soft, voluptuous climate, where the body lies at
ease and suffers the dream fancy “to lose itself
in idle reverie and give a form to the wind and
a spirit to the shadow and the leaf.” He then
sums up his argument.</p>

<p>“We repeat, then, that we wish our native
poets would give a more national character to
their writings. In order to effect this, they have
only to write more naturally, to write from their
own feelings and impressions, from the influence
of what they see around them, and not from any
preconceived notions of what poetry ought to
be, caught by reading many books and imitating
many models. This is peculiarly true in descriptions
of natural scenery. In these, let us
have no more sky-larks and nightingales. For
us they only warble in books. A painter might
as well introduce an elephant or a rhinoceros
into a New England landscape. [This comes,
we must remember, from the young poet who
<span id="pg_79" class="page_anchor">79 </span>had written in his “Angler’s Song” six years
before,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Upward speeds the morning lark</div>
<div class="line">To its silver cloud.”]</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We would not restrict our poets in the choice
of their subjects, or the scenes of their story;
but when they sing under an American sky, and
describe a native landscape, let the description
be graphic, as if it had been seen and not imagined.
We wish, too, to see the figures and
imagery of poetry a little more characteristic, as
if drawn from nature and not from books. Of
this we have constantly recurring examples in
the language of our North American Indians.
Our readers will all recollect the last words of
Pushmataha, the Choctaw chief, who died at
Washington in the year 1824: ‘I shall die, but
you will return to your brethren. As you go
along the paths, you will see the flowers and hear
the birds; but Pushmataha will see them and
hear them no more. When you come to your
home, they will ask you, where is Pushmataha?
and you will say to them, He is no more. They
will hear the tidings <em>like the sound of the fall
of a mighty oak in the stillness of the wood</em>.<ins title="Note: absent in the original">’</ins>
More attention on the part of our writers to
these particulars would give a new and delightful
expression to the face of our poetry. But
the difficulty is, that instead of coming forward
<span id="pg_80" class="page_anchor">80 </span>as bold, original thinkers, they have imbibed the
degenerate spirit of modern English poetry.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_28" id="fnc_28">[28]</a>
What is meant by this last passage is seen when
he goes on to point out that each little village
then had “its little Byron, its self-tormenting
scoffer at morality, its gloomy misanthropist in
song,” and that even Wordsworth, in some respects
an antidote to Byron, was as yet “a very
unsafe model for imitation;” and he farther
points out “how invariably those who have imitated
him have fallen into tedious mannerisms.”
He ends with a moral, perhaps rather tamely
stated: “We hope, however, that ere long some
one of our most gifted bards will throw his
fetters off, and relying on himself alone, fathom
the recesses of his own mind, and bring up rich
pearls from the secret depths of thought.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_29" id="fnc_29">[29]</a></p>

<p>“The true glory of a nation”—this is his
final attitude—“is moral and intellectual preëminence;”
thus distinctly foreshadowing the
title of his friend Charles Sumner’s later oration,
“The True Grandeur of Nations.” American
literature had undoubtedly begun to exist
before this claim was made, as in the prose of
Irving and Cooper, the poetry of Dana and
Bryant. But it had awaited the arrival of some
one to formulate its claims, and this it found
in Longfellow.</p>

<span class="title">APPOINTMENT AT HARVARD AND SECOND VISIT
TO EUROPE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">While</span> he was thus occupied with thoughts
and studies which proved to be more far-seeing
than he knew, the young professor was embarrassed
by financial difficulties in which the
college found itself; and he began after three
years to consider the possibility of a transfer to
other scenes, perhaps to some professorship in
New York or Virginia.</p>

<p>The following letter, hitherto unpublished,
gives us the view taken in the Longfellow house
of another project, namely, that of his succeeding
to the charge of the then famous Round
Hill School at Northampton, about to be abandoned
by its projector, Joseph G. Cogswell. The
quiet judgment of the young wife thus sums it
up in writing to her sister-in-law:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
Sunday afternoon [February, 1834].
</div>

<p>... Henry left us Friday noon in the mail
for Boston, as George will tell you. I do not
like the idea of his going to Northampton at
all—although it would be a most beautiful
<span id="pg_82" class="page_anchor">82 </span>place to reside in. Still I feel sure he would
not like the care of a school, and such an extensive
establishment as that is too. He heard that
Mr. Cogswell was to leave them for Raleigh and
wrote him—in answer to which he received a
long letter, wishing him much to take the place,
&amp;c.; which determined him to go immediately
to Northampton. He requires $1600 to be advanced,
and it would be incurring a certain expense
upon a great uncertainty of gaining more
than a living there. I do not think Henry calculated
at all for such a situation. If he dislikes
so much the care of such a little family as ours,
how can he expect to like the multifarious cares
of such a large one! He has promised not to
decide upon anything till he returns, and I feel
so confident that all uninterested persons will
dissuade him from it, that I rest quite at ease.
I wished him to go to satisfy himself, he was so
very sanguine as to the result of it. We expect
him home the last of next week. This Northampton
business is a profound secret and is not
mentioned out of the family!</p>

<p>Another extract from the same correspondent
shows us how Longfellow was temporarily influenced
at Brunswick, like Lowell afterwards at
Cambridge, by the marked hygienic and even
ascetic atmosphere of the period; an influence
<span id="pg_83" class="page_anchor">83 </span>apparently encouraged in both cases by their
young wives, yet leaving no permanent trace
upon the habits of either poet,—habits always
moderate, in both cases, but never in the literal
sense abstemious.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">

</div>

<p>... He has gone to a Temperance Lecture
this evening. He intends becoming a member
of the Temperance Society; indeed I do not
know but he has signed the paper already. He
is a good little dear, and I approve of everything
(<em>almost</em> smoking) he does. He is becoming
an advocate of vegetable diet, Dr. Mussey’s
hobby; and Clara and I have nothing but lectures
from him and Alexander, upon corsets.</p>

<p>The following extract gives us a glimpse of
his literary work:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Brunswick</span>, Nov. 2, 1834.
</div>

<p>Henry comes on famously with Outre Mer.
The No. on Spain is finished and that on Italy

interesting than any of the other No’s. Henry

the remaining No’s published together in N. Y.
this winter.</p>

<span id="pg_84" class="page_anchor">84 </span>

<p>In the midst of such literary and household
cares he received the following letter:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, December 1, 1834.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">Dear Sir</span>,—Professor Ticknor has given
notice that it is his intention to resign his office
of Smith Professor of Modern Languages in
Harvard University, as soon as the Corporation
shall have fixed upon a successor.</p>

<p>The duty of nominating to that office devolves
upon me; and after great deliberation
and inquiry my determination is made to nominate
you for that office under circumstances
which render your appointment not doubtful,—provided
I receive a previous assurance from
you of your acceptance of it. To ascertain this
is the object of the present letter.</p>

<p>The salary will be fifteen hundred dollars a
year. Residence in Cambridge will be required.
The duties of the professorship will be of course
those which are required from the occupant of a
full professorship, and such as the Corporation
and the Overseers may appoint. If a relation
such as I suggest with this university be acceptable
to you, I shall be obliged by an early answer.</p>

<p>Should it be your wish, previously to entering
upon the duties of the office, to reside in
Europe, at your own expense, a year or eighteen
<span id="pg_85" class="page_anchor">85 </span>months for the purpose of a more perfect attainment
of the German, Mr. Ticknor will retain
his office till your return.</p>

<p>“Good fortune comes at last and I certainly
shall not reject it,” the young Longfellow wrote
to his father. “The last paragraph of the letter,”
he adds, “though put in the form of a permission,
seems to imply a request. I think I
shall accept that also.” Some additional correspondence,
however, proved necessary, such as
follows:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="name">Hon. Josiah Quincy</span>:</p>

<p><span class="salutation">Sir</span>,—Your letter of to-day inclosing the

Lang<sup>s</sup> has been received, and in expressing anew
my desire to meet your wishes fully in the matter
before us, I beg leave to defer an official
answer until my return from the South, in
about three weeks hence.</p>

<p>In the mean time may I take the liberty of
calling your attention once more to the subject
of our last conversation? I feel it important
that I should be regularly appointed before
<span id="pg_86" class="page_anchor">86 </span>sailing for Europe. Otherwise I present myself
as any private individual whatever. But if I
go as one of your professors, I carry with me in
that very circumstance my best letter of recommendation.
It gives me a character—and a
greater claim to attention abroad, than I can
otherwise take with me. Judge Story is ready
to consent to this arrangement—so is Mr.
Gray—so is Mr. Ticknor. If you could bring
the subject once more before the corporation, I
think the objections suggested by you when I
saw you this morning will be found to give way
before the good results, which I think may be
reasonably anticipated from change in your vote
where respectfully suggested.</p>

<p>His first book, in a strict sense, published before
his departure, was his translation of the
“Coplas of Jorge Manrique” (1833), in which
were added to the main poem a few translations
of sonnets, the whole being prefaced with an
article from “The North American Review” on
the “Moral and Devotional Poetry of Spain.”
It was these works which had attracted the
attention of Professor Ticknor, and had led
to results so important. The young professor
sailed at the time mentioned, accompanied by
his wife and two young ladies, her friends.</p>

<p>His first aim was Sweden, but he spent a few
weeks in London, where he met, among others,
Carlyle. So little has hitherto been recorded
of this part of Longfellow’s life or of his early
married life in any way, that I am glad to be
able to describe it from the original letters of
the young wife, which are now in my possession,
and are addressed mainly to Mrs. Longfellow,
her mother-in-law. She seems to have enjoyed
<span id="pg_88" class="page_anchor">88 </span>her travelling experiences very thoroughly, and
writes in one case, “We are generally taken
for French ... and I am always believed to
be Henry’s sister. They say to me, ‘What a
resemblance between your brother and self!’”</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
Sunday afternoon, May 31, 1835.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Mother</span>,—I wrote you a very few
lines, in great haste, in Henry’s letter to his
Father, acknowledging the receipt of your kind
letter. I hope that you will write us as often
as your many cares will permit, &amp; be assured
that even a few lines will always be welcomed
with delight by your absent children. We have
passed our time very delightfully in London.
The only difficulty is—there is so much to be
seen &amp; so little time to see it in. We have, however,
seen many of the principal points. Last
Monday we passed very delightfully at Shirley
Park, near the little village of Croydon. The
ride is through a very beautiful country. We
passed several gipsy encampments, in the most
picturesque situations. Shirley Park is a truly
delightful place. The house, which is a very
fine one, is placed on a beautiful spot, &amp; there
are fine views from all sides of it. Mrs. Skinner,
the lady of the place, is a very agreeable
amiable lady—She took us all over the grounds
in her carriage, &amp; was very kind &amp; attentive
<span id="pg_89" class="page_anchor">89 </span>to us. Her house is thronged with visitors, the
great, the fashionable, &amp; the <em>literati</em> all pay
their court to her. She is a great admirer
of Willis’s, &amp; thinks his writings <em>superior to
Irving’s</em>!—On Wednesday we visited the National
Gallery, the finest collection of old paintings
in the city. We saw while we were there,
the Queen pass into the city, attended by the
horse-guards in their beautiful uniforms. Five
or six carriages passed with a coachman &amp; two
footmen to each, lost almost in the quantity of
gold lace which covered them. Last of all came
her Majesty’s carriage with two coachmen &amp;
four footmen in the same magnificent livery.
Thursday was the king’s birth day. The drawing
room was the most splendid one that had
ever been seen—so Willis says. In the eve’g
there was a grand illumination. About ten
Henry and Mr. Frazer went out to see it. The
crowd was so immense, that it was with the
greatest difficulty they made their way home.
Four women from St. Giles’s armed with large
clubs pointed with iron, passed through the
crowd striking in all directions. We took a
carriage &amp; drove to see the illuminations. It was
after eleven &amp; the crowd had nearly dispersed.
There were brilliant crowns &amp; a variety of pretty
devices formed with coloured lamps &amp; some very
fine gas ones. I suspect however there was very
<span id="pg_90" class="page_anchor">90 </span>little true rejoicing in all this show &amp; splendour.
The Queen is very unpopular among the people.
Friday morn’g—Willis called. He had been
to breakfast with the beautiful Mrs. Wadsworth,
&amp; was on his way, to breakfast at 3 in the aft.
with the Duchess of St. Albans. Mrs. Wadsworth,
from Genesseo, was a Philadelphia lady
&amp; has been greatly admired on the continent &amp;
here. She returns in a few days to America.
Yesterday morning Mr. Barnard a young lawyer
from Connecticut called upon me. He arrived
but a month before us, &amp; takes much the same
route as we do, though a more extensive one.
He will be in Stockholm in the course of the
summer. Mr. Carlyle of Craigenputtock was
soon after announced, &amp; passed an half hour
with us much to our delight. He has very unpolished
manners, &amp; broad Scottish accent, but
such fine language &amp; beautiful thoughts that it
is truly delightful to listen to him. Perhaps you
have read some of his articles in the Edinburgh
Review. He invited us to take tea with him
at Chelsea, where they now reside. We were
as much charmed with Mrs. C[arlyle] as with
her husband. She is a lovely woman with very
simple &amp; pleasing manners. She is also very
talented &amp; accomplished, &amp; how delightful it
is to see such modesty combined with such power
to please. On Tuesday we visit Chantrey’s
<span id="pg_91" class="page_anchor">91 </span>study with them. This morning Mr. Bentham,
a nephew of Jeremy’s, called, &amp; invited us to
dine with them on Wednesday—We may see
the great potentate appear. Henry is petitioning
for room to write, &amp; saying that I must retire,
but I must tell you my dreams. A few
nights since I heard Samuel [Longfellow] preach
for Dr. Nichols. Last night I dreamt I was with
my father &amp; sisters, telling them of all I had
seen. I only went to America to make a call &amp;
tell you all we had safely arrived, &amp; was to return
immediately. You will give very much
love to all for me. They must all write me, &amp;
their letters shall be answered as speedily as
possible. We leave here the last of this week.
I shall leave letters to be sent by the first opportunity.
George &amp; Ann must not forget us.</p>

<p>The Carlyles are again mentioned in a letter

<blockquote class="letter">

<p>... We have some very pleasant passengers.
A German lady with her father and little girl.
What a strange idea foreigners have of America!
This lady who appears very intelligent asked us

dear! I do not know as I shall be able to speak
to you when I return, I see so many lords and
ladies! but in reality these lords and ladies are
not half as agreeable people as some of Henry’s
literary friends. Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle have
more genuine worth and talent than half of the
nobility in London. Mr. Carlyle’s literary fame
is very high, and she is a very talented woman—but
they are people after my own heart—not
the least pretension about them. Mrs. Carlyle
has a pin with Goethe’s head upon it, which
that great author sent her himself. She is very
proud of it I assure you. They live very retired,
not wishing to mix with fashionable society,
which they regard in its true light; still they
have some friends among the nobility who know
how to value them.</p>

<span class="name">Stockholm</span>, August 5, 1835.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Mother</span>,—I hope you have received
my letter to you from London ere this.
We sent letters home from here July 21st by
Capt. Symons directly to Boston—it was as
soon as possible after our arrival; among them
Henry sent a letter to his father, &amp; I to Mary,
Sam &amp; Anne. I was quite delighted to receive
a letter from Mary &amp; Sam—hope they will write
<span id="pg_93" class="page_anchor">93 </span>me often. Since our last letters we have removed
our lodgings to “No. 5. Clara Södra
Kyko Gatan.” We have more rooms but not
as good ones as in the Droteninggatan. We
have made some very pleasant acquaintances
here. July 15th we dined at Mr. Arfwedson’s—the
father of the gentleman who married an
American lady. Mr. A—— resides at Liston
Hill in the Park—he has a little English cottage,
built by Sir Robert Liston, formerly English
minister to this court. It is a sweet spot—the
Mäler flows almost directly beneath the
windows of the cottage—a little flower garden
is upon its banks, &amp; a fine grove of trees in the
rear of the cottage. Mr. Arfwedson is a fine
old man—his wife has been dead several years.
The only ladies present were our countrywoman
Mrs. A—— &amp; the eldest daughter of Mr. Arfwedson—the
wife of Baron S——<ins title="Note: absent in the original">.</ins> She is a
very delicate and graceful lady, was dressed very
tastefully &amp; altogether unlike the Swedish ladies
we had before seen. Mr. A’s second daughter
is just married to a brother of her sister’s husband
who is also a Baron. They went immediately
to Copenhagen, we have not therefore seen
her, but have heard much of her great beauty.
There were a number of gentlemen present at
dinner, several of which were English. The
dinner table was by far the prettiest we have
<span id="pg_94" class="page_anchor">94 </span>seen in Sweden.... The dessert plates were
very beautiful, white china—upon each of which
was a different flower elegantly painted. After
coffee the gentleman proposed a drive to Rosendale,
a little palace in the park. It is the favorite
spot of king Bernadotte. We first went
to the splendid porphyry vase, which stands in
the centre of the flower garden back of the palace.
The top of this celebrated &amp; immense vase
is cut from a single block of porphyry. Sweden
is very celebrated for its fine porphyry. The
lower rooms of the palace are handsomely furnished,
but the upper ones are quite splendid.
All the rooms were carpeted with beautiful carpets—the
walls were hung with silk damask—each
room a different color, with curtains, sofas
&amp; chairs to correspond. One room was hung
with white damask, &amp; the chairs &amp; sofa were
covered with beautiful embroidery—the ground
of which was white, wrought by the Queen &amp;
her maids of honor. There was a great profusion
of this beautiful embroidery—fire screens,
ottomans, &amp;c<ins title="Note: absent in the original">.</ins>—The chandeliers, mirrors &amp; candelabras
were very elegant. In one room was a
portrait of the king, which was very like him.
In another that of the Queen—much flattered.
She was a daughter of a merchant of Marseilles.
There are no bed-chambers in this palace. The
king very rarely sleeps out of his palace in town.
<span id="pg_95" class="page_anchor">95 </span>We returned to Mr. Arfwedson’s &amp; took tea.
Mrs. A—— is very accomplished, she speaks
nearly all the modern languages. She invited
us to dine with them on the next Sabbath.</p>

<p>July 16th. We dined at Mr. Stockoe’s, a
partner of Mr. Erskine’s. We met quite a large
&amp; pleasant party there. The Stockoe’s are excellent,
kind-hearted people. They have paid
us every attention. Mrs. S—— sends us presents
of fruits &amp; flowers, &amp; all those little attentions
which it is so agreeable to receive.—I
was quite unwell on Sunday, on account of
a very long walk the evening previous. I did
not therefore go to young Arfwedson’s. Clara
&amp; H—— went &amp; had a very pleasant visit.
They met there Baron Stackelberg, who was
Swedish minister in America fourteen years.
He returned but two years since. He has called
upon us several times since, &amp; is a jovial old
man with perfectly <em>white</em> hair &amp; whiskers.
July 22nd. The Stockoe’s invited us to drive
out to Haga with them. We went out at six in
the evening. This palace is about two English
miles from town. It was built by Gustavus
the 3rd, &amp; was his favorite residence. The furniture
was very old, but there is one fine room
<em>lined</em> with mirrors. In the drawing room is a
centre table with a deep top &amp; pots of flowers
placed in it. This top was covered entirely with
<span id="pg_96" class="page_anchor">96 </span>moss, this had a very pretty effect, especially as
there were a variety of flowers all in bloom.
The table was on castors &amp; could be placed in any
position.... We were shown three very small
chambers, where Gustavus the 4th was imprisoned
after he was dethroned. His queen lived
with him there. In another building, a pavilion,
were some rooms furnished in more modern style.
The Queen sleeps in these rooms when she comes
to Haga, [but] the royal family rarely visit this
palace. The grounds are very beautiful. We
walked round the Park to the famous palace
which Gustavus 3d commenced building after
his return from Italy. Here he expended two
millions, &amp; the foundations were but laid &amp; the
stones in readiness for the walls when he was
assassinated. The work was then immediately
stopped as the people were much opposed to the
undertaking. We saw the model of this building
which was to have been a very extensive one.
A row of columns all around it, to have been
built in the Italian style. The model was more
like a temple than a palace. We took tea at a
little inn in Hagalund &amp; returned home late in
the evening—The king has a great number
of palaces round Stockholm, there are seven or
eight, &amp; as many it is said in every province.</p>

<p>We have a very pleasant little family of our
own, &amp; have fine times together. Mr. Hughes
<span id="pg_97" class="page_anchor">97 </span>says “for one lady it would have been intolerable,
for two very unpleasant; but for three
quite agreeable.” Henry has been much disappointed
not to receive a letter from his father.
We are now expecting letters every day from
home, &amp; when Wm. Goddard arrives next month
we hope to have many—</p>

<p>Please to give my love to Aunt Lucia &amp; say
to her I shall write her very soon. Be so kind
as to give much love to all the family for me, &amp;
accept much love &amp; respect for yourself &amp; Mr
Longfellow from</p>

weeks.—For my own part, I should like to go
sooner if we could. I am disappointed in Sweden.
The climate is too cold and unpleasant.
I want a little warm sunshine. Something that
I can feel, as well as see. From Gothenburg
<span id="pg_98" class="page_anchor">98 </span>we shall go to Copenhagen, and after passing a
month there, take steamboat to Stettin, and so
to Berlin. We shall not return to the <em>North</em>
again but pass the next summer in Germany
and France.</p>

<p>Much love to all. Very affectionately your
Son</p>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Sir</span>,—Henry has consented that
I should copy a few pages of his journal for
you; but I could not prevail on him to grant
this, till I promised again &amp; again for you,
that you would not on any condition, allow it to
go out of your house. The <em>children</em> can read it
there; &amp; I will ask of you the same favor for
my father and my sisters, for I know they will
take much interest in it.</p>

<p>If it cheers a lonely winter’s evening, or cheats
you of a few melancholy hours, I shall feel most
amply repaid for the trouble I have taken.</p>

<p>We have regretted much to hear of your
feeble health, but hope that your journey has
<span id="pg_99" class="page_anchor">99 </span>quite renovated you. I [was] delighted to
receive a second letter from Mrs. L[ongfellow],
in a p[ackage] of letters which reached us a few
days since. She is very kind to write me, &amp;
I shall not fail to write her, as often as possible,
while absent.</p>

<p>With this you will receive a letter for Aunt
Lucia. I shall answer Mrs. L’s letter very
soon.</p>

<p>Henry has become quite learned in the Swedish,
&amp; can already translate Danish. He is
studying Icelandic also, as I presume he has
told you. He is in fine health &amp; spirits.</p>

<p>With many wishes for your health &amp; my

you both—I am as ever</p>

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Copenhagen</span>, September 22, 1835.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Aunt Lucia</span>,—Pray do not be
alarmed on receiving this letter for fear that
you must answer it. I have not hoped such a
favor, but am content, however much I should
be delighted to hear from you, to write you
occasionally without the hopes of an answer,
thinking &amp; knowing you would be as happy
to receive a letter from me as any of my dear
friends. I received a very entertaining letter
from Anne a few days since. Henry says
“Anne’s letters have some <em>pith</em> to them.” Pray
urge her to write us often, &amp; I shall take just
as much interest in hearing about her family
affairs as if I was in Brunswick.</p>

<p>And so you have made a visit in Boston, &amp;
have been upon railroads, to balloon ascensions,
theatres &amp; I know not what. After such a
quiet life as you have passed for several years,
it must be quite a pleasant little incident, &amp; I
know that you must have enjoyed your visit
much. But, after all, do you not think that
the pleasure of travelling is greatest when it
has been all passed, &amp; you are seated once
more in your quiet home,—&amp; retrace in imagination
your wanderings? It must be so—I
think—then you remember only what is agreeable,
&amp; the thousand little inconveniences, one
must suffer in travelling, are forgotten.</p>

<span id="pg_101" class="page_anchor">101 </span>

<p>I cannot tell you how delighted we all are
that we are out of Sweden. Henry scolds not
a little that a summer <em>in Europe</em> should have
been passed there.</p>

<p>You have heard before this, by our letters
from Gothenburg, that we were detained there a
week, much against our will. We passed the
time, however, very pleasantly. H[enry] delivered
a letter from my Uncle Robert [Storer]
to Mr. Wijk of that place, &amp; he was very attentive
&amp; kind to us. On Sunday the 6th of September
we dined with him, &amp; had the pleasure
of being introduced to his celebrated lady. She
appears as his daughter, being more than thirty
years younger than her husband. We had heard
of her great beauty in America. I cannot say
that she is beautiful, but she is extremely pretty
with very interesting manners. They have
travelled much on the continent &amp; in England.
The dinner was much more American
than any we had seen in Sweden. In the centre
of the table was a high glass dish filled
with a musk-melon &amp; surrounded with flowers.
The remainder of the dessert was not placed
upon the table, but came on after meat, &amp;c., as in
our country. After soup, fish &amp; meat, we had
a <em>nice</em> baked apple pudding; &amp; after this, the
cloth was removed from the nicely polished
round table, &amp; the dessert of cake, apples, pears,
<span id="pg_102" class="page_anchor">102 </span>preserves, nuts &amp; raisins was placed upon it.
Captain Condry from Newburyport dined there,
a very pleasant and gentlemanly man. Mrs.
Wijk urged us to remain to tea, but we left
them soon after dinner.</p>

<p>Monday. 7. In the aft’ walked around Gothenburg,
a pleasant town, &amp; much preferable
as an abiding place to Stockholm, in my opinion.
On returning home found Mr. and Mrs.
Wijk. She looked sweetly &amp; was dressed elegantly.
They called to invite us to pass the
morrow with them, at their country seat.—Tuesday.
8. At eleven in the morning, took a
carriage to Mr. Wijk’s. A long &amp; tedious ride,
one &amp; a quarter Swedish mile from town. We
arrived there at one, found Mr. W[ijk] &amp; his
lady waiting to receive us. We took a walk
round the grounds before dinner. The house
built in a very pretty style &amp; the grounds something
like an English Park. An English gentleman,
a brother-in-law of Mr. Wijk’s dined with
us. He has a country seat adjoining. After
dinner, we walked to this gentleman’s grounds.
They are quite delighted with a fine lake near
the house. We then visited the factories, which
the owner, a man of great mechanical genius, has
erected upon his grounds. We saw all the different
stages the flax went through before weaving
&amp; lastly the weaving itself. We returned
<span id="pg_103" class="page_anchor">103 </span>home &amp; took tea with Mrs. Wijk &amp; then bade
adieu. Found on our return home Mr. Appleton
had arrived from Stockholm. He goes to
Copenhagen with us.</p>

<p>Wednesday. 9. At two in the aft’ we left
Gothenburg, in a little boat for the steamer
station, which is three miles from the town.
Mr. Wijk accompanied us to the wharf. When
we arrived at the steamer pier—found the boat
had not arrived from Christiana, &amp; there we
waited three hours for it. We left about 6 in
the evening. The steamer crowded. We were
obliged to sleep in the gentleman’s cabin, &amp; the
cabin was entirely filled with hammocks swung
one above another.—Thursday. 10. Arrived in
Copenhagen at 2 <small>P.M.</small> Found good accommodations
at the Hotel Royal. Monday. 14. Mr.
Appleton &amp; Mary G—— left us, for London.
Tuesday. 15. In the morning went over the
new palace, not yet entirely completed. It is a
fine building, the rooms very neat, most of them
carpeted. The carpet English, &amp; upon the
king’s apartments of the most ordinary &amp; coarsest
Kidderminster. The Queen’s were Brussels,
but nothing extraordinary. In one large room
was the king’s throne—A gilded chair covered
with crimson velvet, &amp; his initials worked in
gold upon it. The platform, &amp; the steps by
which you ascend to it, were also covered with
<span id="pg_104" class="page_anchor">104 </span>crimson velvet. The window-curtains were superb—of
crimson velvet &amp; a gold vine wrought
upon the edge of them. The Queen’s apartments
were more splendid than the king’s. She
had also a room similar to the king’s, with a
throne like his &amp; curtains the same. The dancing
hall was very fine with seven immense chandeliers
in it.—The king and Queen both had
their dining halls. There was a most splendid
hall for <em>dubbing knights</em>. An immense room,
with gallery all around it, supported by pillars
which appeared like white marble, but were of
some composition. The ceiling was very beautiful,
white with raised gilt figures. The chapel
was very fine; also the hall of justice, where
criminals for high treason, I think, are tried.
There is a throne of crimson velvet at one end,
&amp; three silver lions, with golden manes, as large
as life &amp; in very fierce attitudes are guarding it.</p>

<p>Thursday. 17. In the morning at the museum
of “Northern Antiquities.” The collection has
been made since 20 years &amp; is the largest in
Europe. We were first shown the knives,
chisels, arrows, &amp;c., used before any metal was
discovered &amp; many—many years before Christianity.
They were all of stone. We also saw
the first rude urns which were used for the
burial of dead bodies. Gold, silver &amp; copper
were discovered before iron; when iron was discovered
<span id="pg_105" class="page_anchor">105 </span>it was for a long time so valuable, that
we saw that instruments were made of copper &amp;
only pointed with iron. Thus we were shown
these instruments from their first rude state till
they arrived quite at perfection. We also saw
the gold rings &amp; bracelets which the ancients
wore, &amp; which they cut off, piece by piece, to
give in exchange for clothing or food before the
use of money. We saw a beautiful ebony altar
piece with gold &amp; silver figures raised upon it.
It was intended for a chapel of one of the former
kings; but he afterwards altered his plan &amp;
erected a large church,—so that it has never
been used.</p>

<p>I fear, my dear Aunt, you will find this all
very stupid &amp; tedious, &amp; will not thank me
much for the <em>copious</em> extracts from my poor
little journal. I flatter myself, however, you
will take an interest in all that we do &amp; see, so
I give you the best descriptions in my power.
Copenhagen appears like a different place to us,
from what it did when here before. Henry
would like to pass the winter here, he is now
so charmed with it. We have a much pleasanter
situation, than when here before, &amp; coming
from Sweden any place would be quite delightful.
Indeed it seems now quite like London—the
cries remind us of that city &amp; it appears
almost as noisy. How different from our first
<span id="pg_106" class="page_anchor">106 </span>impression of Copenhagen! but then we were
direct from London &amp; after that immense and
overpowering place everything seems dull and
lifeless. We shall probably leave here this week
Thursday, &amp; shall take these letters to Hamburg
with us, with the hopes of sending them
directly to America from there. Henry sends
books to the college from here, but it is so uncertain
when they go I do not like to leave my
letters. How lonely you will be without Sammy
this winter; I feel very glad he has entered as
Freshman, for we shall have him a year longer
with us. Give much love to all from us—Clara
is very well and seems very happy. She enjoys
travelling very much, &amp; is just as good &amp; excellent
a girl as ever—Henry desires very much
love to Aunt Lucia—accept much from your
ever affectionate</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9">CHAPTER IX<br>

<span class="title">ILLNESS AND DEATH OF MRS. LONGFELLOW</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">This</span> series of happy travelling narratives was
suddenly interrupted by the following letters, now
first printed, to the father of the young wife.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Rotterdam</span>, Dec. 1, 1835.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Sir</span>,—I trust that my last letter
to my father has in some measure prepared your
mind for the melancholy intelligence which this
will bring to you. Our beloved Mary is no
more. She expired on Sunday morning, Nov.
29, without pain or suffering, either of body
or mind, and with entire resignation to the
will of her heavenly Father. Though her sickness
was long, yet I could not bring myself to
think it dangerous until near its close. Indeed,
I did not abandon all hope of her recovery till
within a very few hours of her dissolution, and
to me the blow was so sudden, that I have hardly
yet recovered energy enough to write you the
particulars of this solemn and mournful event.
When I think, however, upon the goodness and
purity of her life, and the holy and peaceful
<span id="pg_108" class="page_anchor">108 </span>death she died, I feel great consolation in my
bereavement, and can say, “Father, thy will be
done.”</p>

<p>Knowing the delicate state of Mary’s health,
I came all the way from Stockholm with fear
and trembling, and with the exception of one
day’s ride from Kiel to Hamburg we came the
whole distance by water. Unfortunately our
passage from Hamburg to Amsterdam in the
Steamboat was rather rough, and Mary was quite
unwell. On the night of our arrival the circumstance
occurred to which I alluded in my last,
[the premature birth of a child] and which has
had this fatal termination.... In Amsterdam we
remained three weeks; and Mary seemed to be
quite restored and was anxious to be gone. To
avoid a possibility of fatigue we took three
days to come to this place—a distance of only
forty miles; and on our arrival here Mary was
in excellent spirits and to all appearances very
well. But alas! the same night she had a relapse
which caused extreme debility, with a low fever,
and nervous headache. This was on the 23d
October. In a day or two she was better, and
on the 27th worse again. After this she seemed
to recover slowly, and sat up for the first time
on the 11th, though only for a short while. This
continued for a day or two longer, till she felt
well enough to sit up for nearly an hour. And
<span id="pg_109" class="page_anchor">109 </span>then she was seized with a violent rheumatism,
and again took to her bed from which she never
more arose.</p>

<p>During all this she was very patient, and generally
cheerful, tho’ at times her courage fainted
and she thought that she should not recover,—wishing
only that she could see her friends at
home once more before she died. At such moments
she loved to repeat these lines [by Andrews
Norton], which seemed to soothe her
feelings:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Father! I thank thee! may no thought</div>
    <div class="line3">E’er deem thy chastisements severe.</div>
<div class="line">But may this heart, by sorrow taught,</div>
    <div class="line3">Calm each wild wish, each idle fear.”</div>
</div>

<p>On Sunday, the 22nd, all her pain had left
her, and she said she had not felt so well during
her sickness. On this day, too, we received a
letter from Margaret, which gave her great pleasure,
and renovated her spirits very much. But
still from day to day she gained no strength.
In this situation she continued during the whole
week—perfectly calm, cheerful and without any
pain. On Friday another letter came from
Margaret, and she listened to it with greatest
delight. A few minutes afterwards a letter from
you and Eliza was brought in, which I reserved
for the next day. When I went to her on Saturday
morning I found her countenance much
<span id="pg_110" class="page_anchor">110 </span>changed, and my heart sank within me. Till
this moment I had indulged the most sanguine
hopes;—but now my fears overmastered them.
She was evidently worse, though she felt as well
as usual. The day passed without change; and
towards evening, as she seemed a little restless
and could not sleep, I sat down by her bedside,
and read your letter and Eliza’s to her. O, I
shall never forget how her eyes and her whole
countenance brightened, and with what a heavenly
smile she looked up into my face as I read.
My own hopes revived again to see that look;
but alas! this was the last gleam of the dying
lamp. Towards ten o’clock she felt a slight
oppression in the chest, with a difficulty of
breathing. I sat down by her side and tried to
cheer her; and as her respiration became more
difficult, she said to me, “Why should I be
troubled; If I die God will take me to himself.”
And from this moment she was perfectly calm,
excepting for a single instant, when she exclaimed,
“O, my dear Father; how he will
mourn for me.” A short time afterwards she
thanked Clara for her kindness, and clasping
her arms affectionately round my neck, kissed
me, and said, “Dear Henry, do not forget me!”
and after this, “Tell my dear friends at home
that I thought of them at the last hour.” I then
read to her from the Church Litany the prayers
<span id="pg_111" class="page_anchor">111 </span>for the sick and dying; and as the nurse
spoke of sending for Dr. Bosworth, the Episcopal
clergyman, Mary said she should like to see
him, and I accordingly sent. He came about
one o’clock, but at this time Mary became apparently
insensible to what was around her; and
at half-past one she ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>Thus all the hopes I had so fondly cherished
of returning home with my dear Mary in happiness
and renovated health have in the providence
of God ended in disappointment and sorrow
unspeakable. All that I have left to me in my
affliction is the memory of her goodness, her
gentleness, her affection for me—unchangeable
in life and in death—and the hope of meeting
her again hereafter, where there shall be no more
sickness, nor sorrow, nor suffering, nor death.
I feel, too, that she must be infinitely, oh, infinitely
happier now than when with us on earth,
and I say to myself,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Peace! peace! she is not dead, she does not sleep!</div>
<div class="line">She has awakened from the dream of life.”</div>
</div>

<p>With my most affectionate remembrance to
Eliza and Margaret, and my warmest sympathies
with you all, very truly yours,</p>

<div class="signature">

</blockquote>

<p>On the 2d of December the young husband
left Rotterdam for Heidelberg. There he spent
<span id="pg_112" class="page_anchor">112 </span>the winter, like Paul Flemming of “Hyperion,”
and buried himself in “old dusty books.” He
met many men who interested him, Schlosser,
Gervinus, and Mittermaier, and also Bryant, the
poet, from his own country, whom he saw for
the first time. An added sorrow came to him
in the death of his brother-in-law and dearest
friend, George W. Pierce, “He the young and
strong,” as he afterwards wrote in his “Footsteps
of Angels;” but in accordance with the
advice of his friend Ticknor he absorbed himself
in intellectual labor, taking the direction of
a careful study of German literature. This he
traced from its foundations down to Jean Paul
Richter, who was for him, as for many other
Americans of the same period, its high-water
mark, even to the exclusion of Goethe. It will
be remembered that Longfellow’s friend, Professor
Felton, translated not long after, and very
likely with Longfellow’s aid or counsel, Menzel’s
“History of German Literature,” in which
Goethe is made quite a secondary figure.</p>

<p>It is also to be noticed that George Bancroft,
one of the half dozen men in America who had
studied at a German University, wrote about the
same time a violent attack on Goethe in the
Boston “Christian Examiner,” in which he pronounced
him far inferior to Voltaire, “not in
genius and industry only, but still more in morality.”
<span id="pg_113" class="page_anchor">113 </span>He says of him farther, “He imitates,
he reproduces, he does not create and he does
not build up.... His chances at popularity
are diminishing. Twaddle will not pass long
for wisdom. The active spirit of movement and
progress finds in his works little that attracts
sympathy.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_34" id="fnc_34">[34]</a> It is to be remembered in the
same connection that Longfellow, in 1837, wrote
to his friend, George W. Greene, of “Jean Paul
Richter, the most magnificent of the German
prose writers,”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_35" id="fnc_35">[35]</a> and it was chiefly on Richter
that his prose style was formed.</p>

<p>In June he left Heidelberg for the Tyrol and
Switzerland, where the scene of “Hyperion”
was laid. He called it “quite a sad and lonely
journey,” but it afterwards led to results both in
his personal and literary career. He sailed for
home in October and established himself in Cambridge
in December, 1836. The following letter
to his wife’s sister was written after his return.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, Sunday evening.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My Dear Eliza</span>,—By tomorrow’s steamboat
I shall send you two trunks, containing
the clothes which once belonged to your sister.
What I have suffered in getting them ready to
send to you, I cannot describe. It is not necessary,
<span id="pg_114" class="page_anchor">114 </span>that I should. Cheerful as I may have
seemed to you at times, there are other times,
when it seems to me that my heart would break.
The world considers grief unmanly, and is suspicious
of that sorrow, which is expressed by
words and outward signs. Hence we strive to
be gay and put a cheerful courage on, when our
souls are very sad. But there are hours, when
the world is shut out, and we can no longer
hear the voices, that cheer and encourage us.
To me such hours come daily. I was so happy
with my dear Mary, that it is very hard to be
alone. The sympathies of friendship are doubtless
something—but after all how little, how
unsatisfying they are to one who has been so
loved as I have been! This is a selfish sorrow,
I know: but neither reason nor reflection can
still it. Affliction makes us childish. A grieved
and wounded heart is hard to be persuaded.
We do not wish to have our sorrow lessened.
There are wounds, which are never entirely
healed. A thousand associations call up the
past, with all its gloom and shadow. Often a
mere look or sound—a voice—the odor of a
flower—the merest trifle is enough to awaken
within me deep and unutterable emotions.
Hardly a day passes, that some face, or familiar
object, or some passage in the book I am reading
does not call up the image of my beloved
<span id="pg_115" class="page_anchor">115 </span>wife so vividly, that I pause and burst into
tears,—and sometimes cannot rally again for
hours.</p>

<p>And yet, my dear Eliza, in a few days, and
we shall all be gone, and others sorrowing and
rejoicing as we now do, will have taken our
places: and we shall say, how childish it was
for us to mourn for things so transitory. There
may be some consolation in this; but we are
nevertheless children. Our feelings overcome
us.</p>

<p>Farewell. Give my kind regards to all, and
believe me most truly and affectionately, your
friend,</p>

<h2 id="chapter-10">CHAPTER X<br>

<span class="title">CRAIGIE HOUSE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">In</span> entering on the duties of his Harvard professorship
(December, 1836) Longfellow took
rooms at the Craigie House in Cambridge. This
house, so long his residence, has been claimed as
having more historic interest than any house in
New England, both from the fact of his ownership
and of its having been the headquarters of
General Washington during the siege of Boston.
It has even been called from these two circumstances
the best known residence in the United
States, with the exception of Mt. Vernon, with
which it has some analogy both in position and
in aspect. It overlooks the Charles River as
the other overlooks the Potomac, though the latter
view is of course far more imposing, and the
Craigie House wants the picturesque semicircle
of outbuildings so characteristic of Mt. Vernon,
while it is far finer in respect to rooms, especially
in the upper stories. It was built, in all probability,
in 1759 by Colonel John Vassall, whose family
owned the still older house across the way
now called the Batchelder House; and there is a
<span id="pg_117" class="page_anchor">117 </span>tradition of a subterranean passage between the
two houses, although this has hitherto been
sought in vain. Both these dwellings belonged to
a series of large houses on Brattle Street, called
Tory Row, whose proprietors were almost all
kinsfolk, owned West India estates and slaves,
entertained company in great affluence, according
to the descriptions of the Baroness Riedesel,
and were almost all forced to leave the country
at the approach of the Revolution. Tradition
recalls a Twelfth Night party given by Mrs.
Washington in 1776, she having come to visit
her husband during his residence in Cambridge.
“She arrived in great ceremony, with a coach
and four black horses, with postilions and servants
in scarlet livery. During her visit she
and her husband celebrated their wedding anniversary,
though the General had to be much
persuaded by his aides.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_37" id="fnc_37">[37]</a> The southeastern
room, afterwards Longfellow’s study, had been
Washington’s office, and the chamber above it
his private room, this being Longfellow’s original
study. The house was bought about 1792, the
dates being a little uncertain, by Andrew Craigie,
apothecary-general of the northern department
of the Revolutionary army, who made additions
to the house, which was described as a princely
<span id="pg_118" class="page_anchor">118 </span>establishment.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_38" id="fnc_38">[38]</a> Mr. Craigie sometimes entertained
a hundred guests at the Commencement
festival, and had among his other guests the celebrated
Talleyrand and the Duke of Kent, Queen
Victoria’s father, then Prince Edward. Mr.
Craigie had large business transactions, speculated
extensively but at last unsuccessfully in
real estate, and died in 1819. His wife long
outlived him, and being poor, let rooms to various
inmates. Edward Everett took his bride there
in 1822, and so did President Jared Sparks in
1832. Five years after, Longfellow took the
rooms, and thus describes his first visit to Mrs.
Craigie:—</p>

<p>“The first time I was in Craigie House was
on a beautiful afternoon in the year 1837. I
came to see Mr. McLane, a law-student, who
occupied the southeastern chamber. The window-blinds
were closed, but through them came
a pleasant breeze, and I could see the waters of
the Charles gleaming in the meadows. McLane
left Cambridge in August, and I took possession
of his room, making use of it as a library or
study, and having the adjoining chamber for my
bedroom. At first Mrs. Craigie declined to let
me have rooms. I remember how she looked as
<span id="pg_119" class="page_anchor">119 </span>she stood, in her white turban, with her hands
crossed behind her, snapping her gray eyes.
She had resolved, she said, to take no more
students into the house. But her manner
changed when I told her who I was. She said
that she had read ‘Outre-Mer,’ of which one
number was lying on her side-board. She then
took me all over the house and showed me every
room in it, saying, as we went into each, that I
could not have that one. She finally consented
to my taking the rooms mentioned above, on
condition that the door leading into the back
entry should be locked on the outside. Young
Habersham, of Savannah, a friend of Mrs. Craigie’s,
occupied at that time the other front chamber.
He was a skilful performer on the flute.
Like other piping birds, he took wing for the
rice-fields of the South when the cold weather
came, and I remained alone with the widow in
her castle. The back part of the house was
occupied, however, by her farmer. His wife supplied
my meals and took care of my rooms.
She was a giantess, and very pious in words;
and when she brought in my breakfast frequently
stopped to exhort me. The exorbitant rate at
which she charged my board was rather at
variance with her preaching. Her name was
Miriam; and Felton called her ‘Miriam, the profitess.’
Her husband was a meek little man.</p>

<span id="pg_120" class="page_anchor">120 </span>

<p>“The winter was a rather solitary one, and
the house very still. I used to hear Mrs. Craigie
go down to breakfast at nine or ten in the morning
and go up to bed at eleven at night. During
the day she seldom left the parlor, where she
sat reading the newspapers and the magazines,—occasionally
a volume of Voltaire. She read
also the English Annuals, of which she had a
large collection. Occasionally, the sound of
voices announced a visitor; and she sometimes
enlivened the long evenings with a half-forgotten
tune upon an old piano-forte.</p>

<p>“During the following summer the fine old
elms in front of the house were attacked by
canker-worms, which, after having devoured the
leaves, came spinning down in myriads. Mrs.
Craigie used to sit by the open windows and let
them crawl over her white turban unmolested.
She would have nothing done to protect the trees
from these worms; she used to say, ‘Why, sir,
they are our fellow-worms; they have as good a
right to live as we have.’”</p>

<p>It was certainly a strange chance which threw
the young poet, on his return from Europe, into
the curiously cosmopolitan atmosphere of Mrs.
Craigie’s mind. The sale catalogue of her books
lies before me, a mass of perhaps five hundred
odd volumes of worthy or worthless literature:
Goethe’s “Werther” beside the American “Frugal
<span id="pg_121" class="page_anchor">121 </span>Housewife,” and Heath’s “Book of Beauty”
beside “Hannah More.” Yet it was doubtless
the only house in Cambridge which then held
complete sets of Voltaire and Diderot, of Molière,
Crébillon, and Florian, Madame de Sévigné
and Madame de Staël. Some of the books
thus sold form a part to this day of the Longfellow
library at Craigie House; but there is no
reference to the poet in the original catalogue,
except that it includes “Outre-Mer,” No. 1,
doubtless the same copy which he saw lying
on the sideboard.</p>

<p>Mr. J. E. Worcester, the lexicographer, shared
the house with Longfellow, as did for a time
Miss Sally Lowell, an aunt of the poet. Mr.
Worcester bought it for himself, and ultimately
sold it to Mr. Nathan Appleton, father of the
second Mrs. Longfellow, to whom he presented
it. Part of the ten magnificent elms of which
Longfellow wrote in 1839 have disappeared.
The ground has been improved by the low-fenced
terrace which he added, and the grounds opposite,
given by the poet’s children to the Longfellow
Memorial Association, have been graded
into a small public park descending nearly to
the river. Within the house all remains much
the same, Longfellow’s library never having been
scattered, although his manuscripts and proof-sheets,
which he preserved and caused to be
<span id="pg_122" class="page_anchor">122 </span>bound in their successive stages in the most
orderly manner, have now been transferred to a
fire-proof building for greater security. The
“old clock on the stairs,” which he himself placed
there, still ticks and strikes the hour; and one
can see cracks in the stairway through which the
mysterious letters dropped morning after morning,
as told in the story of “Esther Wynne’s
Love Letters,” by the accomplished author
known as Saxe Holm. The actual letters were
more commonplace, but they were apparently
written by a schoolgirl under Mr. Craigie’s
care; and there was a tradition, not very well
authenticated, that Longfellow himself had
planned to make them the subject of a poem
before Saxe Holm or Helen Hunt—as the case
may be—had anticipated him in prose.</p>

<p>Such was the house where Longfellow resided
for the rest of his life; seven years of which
passed before his second wedded life began.
The following letter, taken from the Harvard
College papers, will show the interest he took in
the estate.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="salutation">My Dear Sir</span> [President Quincy],—Will
you have the goodness to lay before the Corporation,
at their next meeting, my request concerning
the trees, which I mentioned to you the last
time I had the pleasure of seeing you; viz. that
<span id="pg_123" class="page_anchor">123 </span>they would permit me to take from the College
grounds 3 elm trees to be placed in front of the
Craigie House.</p>

<p>I am endeavoring to replace, as well as possible,
the old elms, and find it difficult to obtain
many of the size I desire. Some parts of the
College ground are so thickly planted that a
tree may be removed, here &amp; there, without
at all impairing the beauty of the grounds. I
therefore request permission to remove any 3
trees that the College Steward shall say may be
taken without detriment to the College property.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-11">CHAPTER XI<br>

<span class="title">HYPERION AND THE REACTION FROM IT</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">“Outre-Mer”</span> had been published some time
before, with moderate success, but “Hyperion”
was destined to attract far more attention. It
is first mentioned in his journal on September
13, 1838, though in a way which shows that it
had been for some time in preparation, and its
gradual development is traceable through the
same channel. One entire book, for instance,
was written and suppressed, namely, “St. Clair’s
Day Book,” the hero having first been christened
Hyperion, then St. Clair, and then Paul Flemming.
Its author wrote of it, “I called it ‘Hyperion,’
because it moves on high among clouds
and stars, and expresses the various aspirations
of the soul of man. It is all modelled on this
idea, style and all. It contains my cherished
thoughts for three years.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_40" id="fnc_40">[40]</a></p>

<p>The cordiality with which “Hyperion” was received
was due partly to the love story supposed to
be implied in it, and largely to the new atmosphere
of German life and literature which it opened to
<span id="pg_125" class="page_anchor">125 </span>Americans. It must always be remembered that
the kingdom in which Germany then ruled was
not then, as now, a kingdom of material force
and business enterprise, but as Germans themselves
claimed, a kingdom of the air; and into
that realm Hyperion gave to Americans the first
glimpse. The faults and limitations which we
now see in it were then passed by, or visible only
to such keen critics as Orestes A. Brownson,
who wrote thus of it in “The Boston Quarterly
Review,” then the ablest of American periodicals
except “The Dial:” “I do not like the book.
It is such a journal as a man who reads a great
deal makes from the scraps in his table-drawer.
Yet it has not the sincerity or quiet touches
which give interest to the real journals of very
common persons. It is overloaded with prettinesses,
many of which would tell well in conversation,
but being rather strown over than woven
into his narrative, deform where they should
adorn. You cannot guess why the book was
written, unless because the author were tired of
reading these morceaux to himself, for there has
been no fusion or fermentation to bring on the
hour of utterance. Then to me the direct personal
relation in which we are brought to the
author is unpleasing. Had he but idealized his
tale, or put on the veil of poetry! But as it is,
we are embarrassed by his extreme communicativeness,
<span id="pg_126" class="page_anchor">126 </span>and wonder that a man, who seems in
other respects to have a mind of delicate texture,
could write a letter about his private life to a
public on which he had as yet established no
claim.... Indeed this book will not add to the
reputation of its author, which stood so fair
before its publication.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_41" id="fnc_41">[41]</a> This is the criticism of
which Longfellow placidly wrote, “I understand
there is a spicy article against me in the ‘Boston
Quarterly.’ I shall get it as soon as I can; for,
strange as you may think it, these things give
me no pain.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_42" id="fnc_42">[42]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Howells, in one of the most ardent eulogies
ever written upon the works of Longfellow,
bases his admiration largely upon the claim
“that his art never betrays the crudeness or imperfection
of essay,”—that is, of experiment.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_43" id="fnc_43">[43]</a>
It would be interesting to know whether this accomplished
author, looking back upon “Hyperion”
more than thirty years later, could reindorse
this strong assertion. To others, I fancy,
however attractive and even fascinating the
book may still remain, it has about it a distinctly
youthful quality which, while sometimes
characterizing even his poetry, unquestionably
marked his early prose. A later and younger
<span id="pg_127" class="page_anchor">127 </span>critic says more truly of it, I think, “Plainly in
the style of Richter, with all the mingled grandeur
and grotesqueness of the German romanticists,
it is scarcely now a favorite with the adult
reader; though the young, obedient to some
vague embryonic law, still find in it for a season
the pleasure, the thrilling melancholy, which
their grandfathers found.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_44" id="fnc_44">[44]</a> But Professor Carpenter,
speaking from the point of view of the
younger generation, does not fail to recognize
that Paul Flemming’s complaints cease when he
reads the tombstone inscription which becomes
the motto of the book; and I recall with pleasure
that, being a youth nurtured on “Hyperion,” I
selected that passage for the text of my boyish
autobiography written in the Harvard “Class
Book” at the juvenile age of seventeen. Dozens
of youths were perhaps adopting the motto in
the same way at the same time, and it is useless
to deny to a book which thus reached youthful
hearts the credit of having influenced the whole
period of its popularity.</p>

<p>Apart from the personal romance which his
readers attached to it, the book had great value
as the first real importation into our literature
of the wealth of German romance and song.
So faithful and ample are its local descriptions
that a cheap edition of it is always on sale at
<span id="pg_128" class="page_anchor">128 </span>Heidelberg, and every English and American
visitor to that picturesque old city seems to know
the book by heart. Bearing it in his hand, the
traveller still climbs the rent summit of the Gesprengte
Thurm and looks down upon the throng
in the castle gardens; or inquires vainly for the
ruined linden-tree, or gives a sigh to the fate of
Emma of Ilmenau, and murmurs solemnly,—as
a fat and red-faced Englishman once murmured
to me on that storied spot,—“That night there
fell a star from heaven!” There is no doubt
that under the sway of the simpler style now
prevailing, much of the rhetoric of “Hyperion”
seems turgid, some of its learning obtrusive, and
a good deal of its emotion forced; but it was
nevertheless an epoch-making book for a generation
of youths and maidens, and it still retains
its charm. The curious fact, however, remains—a
fact not hitherto noticed, I think, by biographers
or critics—that at the very time when
the author was at work on “Hyperion,” there
was a constant reaction in his mind that was
carrying him in the direction of more strictly
American subjects, handled under a simpler
treatment. He wrote on September 13, 1838,
“Looked over my notes and papers for ‘Hyperion.’
Long for leisure to begin once more.” It
is impossible to say how long a preparation this
implies; it may have been months or years. Yet
<span id="pg_129" class="page_anchor">129 </span>the following letter to a young girl, his wife’s
youngest sister, shows how, within less than a
year previous, his observation had been again
turned towards the American Indians as a
theme.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, October 29, 1837.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My Dear Margaret</span>,—I was very much
delighted with your present of the slippers.
They are too pretty to be trodden under foot;
yet such is their destiny, and shall be accomplished,
as soon as may be. The colors look
beautifully upon the drab ground; much more
so than on the black. Don’t you think so? I
should have answered your note, and sent you
my thanks, by Alexander on Wednesday last;
but when I last saw him, I had not received the
package. Therefore you must not imagine from
my delay, that I do not sufficiently appreciate the
gift....</p>

<p>There is nothing very new in Boston, which
after all is a gossiping kind of <em>Little Peddlington</em>,
if you know what that is; if you don’t, you
must read the story. People take too much cognizance
of their neighbors; interest themselves
too much in what no way concerns them. However,
it is no great matter.</p>

<p>There are Indians here: savage fellows;—one
Black-Hawk and his friends, with naked
shoulders and red blankets wrapped about their
<span id="pg_130" class="page_anchor">130 </span>bodies:—the rest all grease and Spanish brown
and vermillion. One carries a great war-club,
and wears horns on his head; another had his
face painted like a grid-iron, all in bands:—another
is all red, like a lobster; and another
black and blue, in great daubs of paint laid
on not sparingly. Queer fellows!—One great
champion of the <em>Fox</em> nation had a short pipe in
his mouth, smoking with great self-complacency
as he marched out of the City Hall: another
was smoking a cigar! Withal, they looked
very formidable. Hard customers....</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note, again, how this tendency to home themes
asserts itself explicitly in Longfellow’s notice of
Hawthorne’s “Twice-Told Tales” at about the
same time in “The North American Review,”
(July, 1837):—</p>

<p>“One of the most prominent characteristics
of these tales is, that they are national in their
character. The author has wisely chosen his
themes among the traditions of New England;
the dusty legends of ‘the good Old Colony
times, when we lived under a king.’ This is
the right material for story. It seems as natural
to make tales out of old tumble-down
<span id="pg_131" class="page_anchor">131 </span>traditions, as canes and snuff-boxes out of old
steeples, or trees planted by great men. The
puritanical times begin to look romantic in the
distance. Who would not like to have strolled
through the city of Agamenticus, where a market
was held every week, on Wednesday, and
there were two annual fairs at St. James’s and
St. Paul’s? Who would not like to have been
present at the court of the Worshipful Thomas
Gorges, in those palmy days of the law, when
Tom Heard was fined five shillings for being
drunk, and John Payne the same, ‘for swearing
one oath’? Who would not like to have seen
the time, when Thomas Taylor was presented to
the grand jury ‘for abusing Captain Raynes,
being in authority, by <em>thee-ing</em> and <em>thou-ing</em>
him;’ and John Wardell likewise, for denying
Cambridge College to be an ordinance of God;
and when some were fined for winking at comely
damsels in church; and others for being common-sleepers
there on the Lord’s day? Truly,
many quaint and quiet customs, many comic
scenes and strange adventures, many wild and
wondrous things, fit for humorous tale, and
soft, pathetic story, lie all about us here in New
England. There is no tradition of the Rhine
nor of the Black Forest, which can compare in
beauty with that of the Phantom Ship. The
Flying Dutchman of the Cape, and the Klabotermann
<span id="pg_132" class="page_anchor">132 </span>of the Baltic, are nowise superior. The
story of Peter Rugg, the man who could not
find Boston, is as good as that told by Gervase
of Tilbury, of a man who gave himself to the
devils by an unfortunate imprecation, and was
used by them as a wheelbarrow; and the Great
Carbuncle of the White Mountains shines with
no less splendor, than that which illuminated the
subterranean palace in Rome, as related by
William of Malmesbury. Truly, from such a
Fortunatus’s pocket and wishing-cap, a tale-bearer
may furnish forth a sufficiency of ‘peryllous
adventures right espouventables, bryfefly
compyled and pyteous for to here.’”</p>

<p>We must always remember that Longfellow
came forward at a time when cultivated Americans
were wasting a great deal of superfluous
sympathy on themselves. It was the general impression
that the soil was barren, that the past
offered no material and they must be European
or die. Yet Longfellow’s few predecessors had
already made themselves heard by disregarding
this tradition and taking what they found on
the spot. Charles Brockden Brown, although
his style was exotic and Godwinish, yet found
his themes among American Indians and in the
scenes of the yellow fever in Philadelphia. It
was not Irving who invested the Hudson with
romance, but the Hudson that inspired Irving.
<span id="pg_133" class="page_anchor">133 </span>When in 1786, Mrs. Josiah Quincy, then a young
girl, sailed upon that river in a sloop, she wrote,
“Our captain had a legend for every scene,
either supernatural or traditional or of actual
occurrence during the war, and not a mountain
reared its head unconnected with some marvellous
story.” Irving was then but three years
old, yet Ichabod Crane and Rip Van Winkle or
their prototypes were already on the spot waiting
for biographers; and it was much the same
with Cooper, who was not born until three years
later. What was needed was self-confidence and
a strong literary desire to take the materials at
hand. Irving, Cooper, Dana, had already done
this; but Longfellow followed with more varied
gifts, more thorough training; the “Dial”
writers followed in their turn, and a distinctive
American literature was born, this quality reaching
a climax in Thoreau, who frankly wrote, “I
have travelled a great deal—in Concord.”</p>

<p>And while thus Longfellow found his desire
for a national literature strengthened at every
point by the example of his classmate Hawthorne,
so he may have learned much, though not immediately,
through the warning unconsciously
given by Bryant, against the perils of undue
moralizing. Bryant’s early poem, “To a Water-Fowl,”
was as profound in feeling and as perfect
in structure as anything of Longfellow’s, up to
<span id="pg_134" class="page_anchor">134 </span>the last verse, which some profane critic compared
to a tin kettle of moralizing, tied to the legs
of the flying bird. Whittier’s poems had almost
always some such appendage, and he used to
regret in later life that he had not earlier been
contented to leave his moral for the reader to
draw, or in other words, to lop off habitually
the last verse of each poem. Apart from this
there was a marked superiority, even on the
didactic side, in Longfellow’s moralizing as
compared with Bryant’s. There is no light or
joy in the “Thanatopsis;” but Longfellow, like
Whittier, was always hopeful. It was not alone
that he preached, as an eminent British critic
once said to me, “a safe piety,” but his religious
impulse was serene and even joyous, and
this under the pressure of the deepest personal
sorrows.</p>

<p>It is also to be observed that Longfellow wrote
in this same number of “The North American
Review” (July, 1837) another paper which was
prophetic with regard to prose style, as was the
Hawthorne essay in respect to thought. It was
a review of Tegner’s “Frithiof’s Saga” which
showed a power of description, brought to bear
on Swedish life and scenery, which he really
never quite attained in “Hyperion,” because it
was there sometimes vitiated by a slightly false
note. A portion of it was used afterwards as a
<span id="pg_135" class="page_anchor">135 </span>preface to his second volume of poems (“Ballads
and Other Poems”), a preface regarded by
some good critics as Longfellow’s best piece of
prose work. It was, at any rate, impossible
not to recognize a fresh and vigorous quality
in a descriptive passage opening thus; and I
can myself testify that it stamped itself on the
memories of young readers almost as vividly
as the ballads which followed:—</p>

<p>“There is something patriarchal still lingering
about rural life in Sweden, which renders
it a fit theme for song. Almost primeval simplicity
reigns over that northern land,—almost
primeval solitude and stillness. You pass out
from the gate of the city, and, as if by magic,
the scene changes to a wild, woodland landscape.
Around you are forests of fir. Overhead hang
the long, fan-like branches, trailing with moss,
and heavy with red and blue cones. Under
foot is a carpet of yellow leaves; and the air
is warm and balmy. On a wooden bridge you
cross a little silver stream; and anon come
forth into a pleasant and sunny land of farms.
Wooden fences divide the adjoining fields.
Across the road are gates, which are opened
by troops of children. The peasants take off
their hats as you pass; you sneeze, and they
cry, ‘God bless you.’ The houses in the villages
and smaller towns are all built of hewn
<span id="pg_136" class="page_anchor">136 </span>timber, and for the most part painted red. The
floors of the taverns are strewn with the fragrant
tips of fir boughs. In many villages
there are no taverns, and the peasants take
turns in receiving travellers. The thrifty
housewife shows you into the best chamber, the
walls of which are hung round with rude pictures
from the Bible; and brings you her heavy
silver spoons,—an heirloom,—to dip the curdled
milk from the pan. You have oaten cakes
baked some months before; or bread with anise-seed
and coriander in it, or perhaps a little pine
bark.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-12">CHAPTER XII<br>

<span class="title">VOICES OF THE NIGHT</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">There</span> was never any want of promptness
or of industry about Longfellow, though his time
was apt to be at the mercy of friends or strangers.
“Hyperion” appeared in the summer of
1839, and on September 12, 1839, he writes the
title of his volume, “Voices of the Night;” five
days later he writes, still referring to it:—</p>

<p>“First, I shall publish a collection of poems.
Then,—History of English Poetry.</p>

<p>“Studies in the Manner of Claude Lorraine;
a series of Sketches.</p>

<p>“Count Cagliostro; a novel.</p>

<p>“The Saga of Hakon Jarl; a poem.”</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that neither of these four
projects, except it be the second, seems to imply
that national character of which he dreamed
when the paper in “The North American Review”
was written. It is also to be noticed that,
as often happens with early plans of authors,
none of these works ever appeared, and perhaps
not even the beginning was made. The title of
“The Saga” shows that his mind was still engaged
<span id="pg_138" class="page_anchor">138 </span>with Norse subjects. Two months after
he writes, “Meditating what I shall write next.
Shall it be two volumes more of ‘Hyperion;’ or
a drama of Cotton Mather?” Here we come
again upon American ground, yet he soon quits
it. He adds after an interruption, “Cotton
Mather? or a drama on the old poetic legend of
Der <ins title="Note: the correct form would be “Arme”, possible written incorrectly by Longfellow himself">Armer</ins> Heinrich? The tale is exquisite. I
have a heroine as sweet as Imogen, could I but
paint her so. I think I must try this.” Here
we have indicated the theme of the “Golden
Legend.” Meantime he was having constant
impulses to write special poems, which he often
mentioned as Psalms. One of these was the
“Midnight Mass for the Dying Year,” which he
first called an “Autumnal Chant.” Soon after
he says, “Wrote a new Psalm of Life. It is
‘The Village Blacksmith.’” It is to be noticed
that the “Prelude,” probably written but a short
time before the publication of “Voices of the
Night,” includes those allusions which called
forth the criticism of Margaret Fuller to the
“Pentecost” and the “bishop’s caps.” Yet after
all, the American Jews still observe Whitsunday
under the name of Pentecost, and the
flower mentioned may be the <em>Mitella diphylla</em>,
a strictly North American species, though without
any distinctly “golden ring.” It has a faint
pink suffusion, while the presence of a more
<span id="pg_139" class="page_anchor">139 </span>marked golden ring in a similar and commoner
plant, the <em>Tiarella Pennsylvanica</em>, leads one to a
little uncertainty as to which flower was meant,
a kind of doubt which would never accompany
a floral description by Tennyson.</p>

<p>It is interesting to put beside this inspirational
aspect of poetry the fact that the poet at one
time planned a newspaper with his friends Felton
and Cleveland, involving such a perfectly
practical and business-like communication as this,
with his publisher, Samuel Colman, which is as
follows:<a class="footnote" href="#fn_46" id="fnc_46">[46]</a>—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, July 6, 1839.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Sir</span>,—In compliance with your
wishes I have ordered 2200 copies of Hyperion
to be printed. I do it with the understanding,
that you will give your notes for $250 each, instead
of the sums mentioned in the agreement:
and that I shall be allowed 50 copies instead of
25 for distribution. This will leave you 150,
which strikes me as a very large number.</p>

<p>The first Vol. (212 pp.) will be done to-day:
and the whole in a fortnight, I hope. It is <em>very</em>
handsome; and those who praise you for publishing
<em>handsome</em> books, will have some reason
for saying so.</p>

<p>Will you have the books, or any part of them
<span id="pg_140" class="page_anchor">140 </span>done up here?—and in the English style, uncut?—Those
for the Boston market I should
think you would.</p>

<p>With best regards to Mellen and Cutler,</p>

<p>P. S. By the way; I was shocked yesterday to
see in the New York Review that <em>Undine</em> was
coming out in your Library of Romance. This
is one of the tales of the Wonderhorn. Have
you forgotten? I intend to come to New York,
as soon as I get through with printing Hyperion;
and we will bring this design to an arrangement,
and one more beside.</p>

<p>That was at a time when it was quite needful
that American authors should be business-like,
since American publishers sometimes were not.
The very man to whom this letter was addressed
became bankrupt six months later; half the edition
of “Hyperion” (1200 copies) was seized
by creditors and was locked up, so that the book
was out of the market for four months. “No
matter,” the young author writes in his diary,
“I had the glorious satisfaction of writing it.”
Meanwhile the “Knickerbocker” had not paid
its contributors for three years, and the success
<span id="pg_141" class="page_anchor">141 </span>of “Voices of the Night” was regarded as signal,
because the publisher had sold 850 copies
in three weeks.</p>

<p>The popularity of the “Voices of the Night,”
though not universal, was very great. Hawthorne
wrote to him of these poems, “Nothing
equal to some of them was ever written in this
world,—this western world, I mean; and it
would not hurt my conscience much to include
the other hemisphere.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_47" id="fnc_47">[47]</a> Halleck also said of
the “Skeleton in Armor” that there was “nothing
like it in the language,” and Poe wrote to
Longfellow, May 3, 1841, “I cannot refrain
from availing myself of this, the only opportunity
I may ever have, to assure the author of
the ‘Hymn to the Night,’ of the ‘Beleaguered
City,’ and of the ‘Skeleton in Armor’ of the
fervent admiration with which his genius has
inspired me.”</p>

<p>In most of the criticisms of Longfellow’s earlier
poetry, including in this grouping even the
“Psalm of Life,” we lose sight of that fine remark
of Sara Coleridge, daughter of the poet,
who said to Aubrey de Vere, “However inferior
the bulk of a young man’s poetry may be to that
of the poet when mature, it generally possesses
some passages with a special freshness of their
own and an inexplicable charm to be found in
<span id="pg_142" class="page_anchor">142 </span>them alone.” Professor Wendell’s criticisms on
Longfellow, in many respects admirable, do not
seem to me quite to recognize this truth, nor
yet the companion fact that while Poe took captive
the cultivated but morbid taste of the French
public, it was Longfellow who called forth more
translators in all nations than all other Americans
put together. If, as Professor Wendell
thinks, the foundation of Longfellow’s fame was
the fact that he introduced our innocent American
public to “the splendors of European civilization,”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_48" id="fnc_48">[48]</a>
how is it that his poems won and held
such a popularity among those who already had
these splendors at their door? It is also to be
remembered that he was, if this were all, in some
degree preceded by Bryant, who had opened the
doors of Spanish romance to young Americans
even before Longfellow led them to Germany and
Italy.</p>

<p>Yet a common ground of criticism on Longfellow’s
early poems lay in the very simplicity
which made them, then and ever since, so near
to the popular heart. Digby, in one of his agreeable
books, compares them in this respect to
the paintings of Cuyp in these words: “The
objects of Cuyp, for instance, are few in number
and commonplace in their character—a bit
of land and water, a few cattle and figures in
<span id="pg_143" class="page_anchor">143 </span>no way remarkable. His power, says a critic,
reminds me of some of the short poems of Longfellow,
where things in themselves most prosaic
are flooded with a kind of poetic light from the
inner soul.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_49" id="fnc_49">[49]</a> It is quite certain that one may go
farther in looking back upon the development
of our literature and can claim that this simplicity
was the precise contribution needed at that
early and formative period. Literature in a
new country naturally tends to the florid, and
one needs only to turn to the novels of Charles
Brockden Brown, or even Bancroft’s “History
of the United States,” to see how eminently this
was the case in America. Whatever the genius
of Poe, for instance, we can now see that he represented,
in this respect, a dangerous tendency,
and Poe’s followers and admirers exemplified it
in its most perilous form. Take, for instance,
such an example as that of Dr. Thomas Holley
Chivers of Georgia, author of “Eonchs of
Ruby,” a man of whom Bayard Taylor wrote in
1871, speaking of that period thirty years earlier,
“that something wonderful would come out of
Chivers.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_50" id="fnc_50">[50]</a> It is certain that things wonderful
came out of him at the very beginning, for we
owe to him the statement that “as the irradiancy
<span id="pg_144" class="page_anchor">144 </span>of a diamond depends upon its diaphanous translucency,
so does the beauty of a poem upon its
rhythmical crystallization of the Divine Idea.”
One cannot turn a page of Chivers without recognizing
that he at his best was very closely
allied to Poe at his worst. Such a verse as
the following was not an imitation, but a twin
blossom:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“On the beryl-rimmed rebecs of Ruby</div>
  <div class="line2">Brought fresh from the hyaline streams,</div>
<div class="line">She played on the banks of the Yuba</div>
  <div class="line2">Such songs as she heard in her dreams,</div>
<div class="line">Like the heavens when the stars from their eyries</div>
  <div class="line2">Look down through the ebon night air,</div>
<div class="line">Where the groves by the Ouphantic Fairies</div>
  <div class="line2">Lit up for my Lily Adair,</div>
  <div class="line2">For my child-like Lily Adair,</div>
  <div class="line2">For my heaven-born Lily Adair,</div>
  <div class="line2">For my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair.”</div>
</div>

<p>It is easy to guess that Longfellow, in his
“North American Review” article, drew from
Dr. Chivers and his kin his picture of those
“writers, turgid and extravagant,” to be found
in American literature. He farther says of
them: “Instead of ideas, they give us merely
the signs of ideas. They erect a great bridge
of words, pompous and imposing, where there is
hardly a drop of thought to trickle beneath. Is
not he who thus apostrophizes the clouds, ‘Ye
posters of the wakeless air!’ quite as extravagant
as the Spanish poet, who calls a star a
<span id="pg_145" class="page_anchor">145 </span>‘burning doubloon of the celestial bank’?”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_51" id="fnc_51">[51]</a>
It is a curious fact that this exuberant poet
Chivers claimed a certain sympathy<a class="footnote" href="#fn_52" id="fnc_52">[52]</a> with the
Boston “Dial” and with the transcendental
movement, which had a full supply of its own extravagances;
and it is clear that between these
two rhetorical extremes there was needed a voice
for simplicity. Undoubtedly Bryant had an influence
in the same direction of simplicity. But
Bryant seemed at first curiously indifferent to
Longfellow. “Voices of the Night” was published
in 1839, and there appeared two years
after, in 1841, a volume entitled “Selections
from the American Poets,” edited by Bryant, in
which he gave eleven pages each to Percival and
Carlos Wilcox, nine to Pierpont, eight to himself,
and only four to Longfellow. It is impossible
to interpret this proportion as showing that
admiration which Bryant seems to have attributed
to himself five years later when he wrote
to him of the illustrated edition of his poems,
“They appear to be more beautiful than on
former readings, much as I then admired them.
The exquisite music of your verse dwells more
than ever on my ear.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_53" id="fnc_53">[53]</a> Their personal relation
<span id="pg_146" class="page_anchor">146 </span>remained always cordial, but never intimate,
Longfellow always recognizing his early obligations
to the elder bard and always keeping by
him the first edition of Bryant’s poems, published
in 1821. Both poets were descended from a
common pilgrim ancestry in John Alden and
Priscilla Mullins, whose story Longfellow has
told.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_54" id="fnc_54">[54]</a></p>

<p>Thus much for first experiences with the
world of readers. The young professor’s academical
standing and services must be reserved
for another chapter. But he at once found himself,
apart from this, a member of a most agreeable
social circle, for which his naturally cheerful
temperament admirably fitted him. It is
indeed doubtful if any Harvard professor of
to-day could record in his note-books an equally
continuous course of mild festivities. There
are weeks when he never spends an evening at
home. He often describes himself as “gloomy,”
but the gloom is never long visible. He constantly
walks in and out of Boston, or drives
to Brookline or Jamaica Plain; and whist and
little suppers are never long omitted. Lowell
was not as yet promoted to his friendship because
of youth, nor had he and Holmes then
been especially brought together, but Prescott,
Sumner, Felton, and others constantly appear.
<span id="pg_147" class="page_anchor">147 </span>He draws the line at a fancy ball, declining to
costume himself for that purpose; and he writes
that he never dances, but in other respects spends
his evenings after his own inclination. Two
years later, however, he mentions his purpose of
going to a subscription ball “for the purpose of
dancing with elderly ladies,” who are, he thinks,
“much more grateful for slight attentions than
younger ones.”</p>

<p>It is curious to find the fact made prominent
by all contemporary critics, in their references
to the young professor, that he was at this time
not only neat in person, but with a standard of
costume which made him rather exceptional. To
those accustomed to the average dress of instructors
in many colleges up to this day, this spirit
of criticism may afford no surprise. His brother
tells us that “good Mrs. Craigie thought he had
somewhat too gay a look,” and “had a fondness
for colors in coats, waistcoats, and neckties.”
It will be remembered that in “Hyperion” he
makes the Baron say to Paul Flemming, “The
ladies already begin to call you Wilhelm Meister,
and they say that your gloves are a shade
too light for a strictly virtuous man.” He wrote
also to Sumner when in Europe: “If you have
any tendency to curl your hair and wear gloves
like Edgar in ‘Lear,’ do it before your return.”
It is a curious fact that he wrote of himself
<span id="pg_148" class="page_anchor">148 </span>about the same time to his friend, George W.
Greene, in Rome: “Most of the time am alone;
smoke a good deal; wear a broad-brimmed hat,
black frock coat, a black cane.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_55" id="fnc_55">[55]</a></p>

<p>Of the warmth of heart which lay beneath
this perhaps worldly exterior, the following letter
to his youthful sister-in-law gives evidence:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<h2 id="chapter-13">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<span class="title">THIRD VISIT TO EUROPE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> year 1841 was on the whole a rather
dazzling period for the young poet. His first
volume had been received with enthusiasm. His
second volume was under way. He had a circle
of friends always ready to criticise any new
poem or to propose themes for other works;
chief among the latter being his friend Samuel
Ward, in New York, who suggested the
“Phantom Ship,” on the basis of a legend in
Mather’s “Magnalia,” and urged the translation
of Uhland’s “Das Glück von Edenhall” and
Pfizer’s “Junggesell.” A scrap of newspaper,
bearing the seal of the State of New York with
the motto “Excelsior,” suggested the poem of
that name. “The Skeleton in Armor” was included
within the book and was originally to
have given the title to it. Prescott, the historian,
said that this poem and the “Hesperus”
were the best imaginative poems since Coleridge’s
“Ancient Mariner.” Reading the tenth
chapter of Mark in Greek, Longfellow thought
of “Blind Bartimeus.” He wrote to his father
<span id="pg_150" class="page_anchor">150 </span>that he liked the last two poems in the volume
best, and thought them perhaps as good as anything
he had written,—these being “Maidenhood”
and “Excelsior.” It was also in this
year that he conceived the plan of the “Spanish
Student” and of “a long and elaborate poem
by the holy name of ‘Christ,’ the theme of which
would be the various aspects of Christendom in
the Apostolic, Middle, and Modern Ages.” It
shows the quiet persistence of the poet’s nature
that this plan, thus conceived in 1841, was
brought to a final conclusion, more than thirty
years after, in 1873, and under the very name
originally conceived, that of “Christus.” Thus
much for this year of poetic achievement. His
journals, as published by his brother, show the
activity of social life which the year also included;
and, above all, his regular academic
work was of itself continuous and exhausting.
In the schedule of university lectures, announced
in the college catalogue for 1841–2,
one finds the following entry: “On the <em>French,
Spanish, Italian, and German languages and
literature</em>, by Professor Longfellow.” In the
list of officers there appear only three instructors
as doing the detailed work of instruction
under this professor, and the lecturing was done
entirely by him, occupying three hours a week,
on the afternoons of Monday, Wednesday, and
<span id="pg_151" class="page_anchor">151 </span>Friday. He was designated in the catalogue
as “Smith Professor of the French and Spanish
languages and literature and Professor of
Belles Lettres,” whatever this last phrase may
have been construed as including. He had also
the supervision of his subordinates, the examination
of written exercises, and the attendance
upon faculty meetings; and it certainly is no
cause for wonder that the following letters
should have passed between him and the college
authorities.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
[1839].
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">Gentlemen</span>,—I respectfully beg leave to
call your attention once more to the subject of
my duties as Smith Professor in the University.
You will recollect that when I entered upon my
labors in the Department of Modern Languages,
the special duties, which devolved upon me as
Head of that Department, and Professor of
Belles Lettres, were agreed upon by a Committee
of the Corporation and myself. Native
teachers having always been employed to instruct
in the elements and pronunciation of the
Modern Languages, the general supervision of
the Department, instruction in some of the
higher works of modern foreign literature, and
certain courses of Lectures were assigned to me.
This arrangement, so far as I know, proved satisfactory
to all the parties concerned.</p>

<span id="pg_152" class="page_anchor">152 </span>

<p>You will also recollect, that in the Summer of
1838, two gentlemen, namely the French and the
German Instructors, for reasons which it is unnecessary
to specify, resigned. Another German
teacher was immediately appointed; but as
no suitable person occurred at the moment to
fill the place of French Instructor, the appointment
of one was postponed for a season, and
I consented to take charge of the Classes in
that language. I would respectfully remind you
of the distinct understanding at the time, that
this arrangement was to be only a temporary
one, and to be given up as soon as a suitable appointment
could be made. It so happened, however,
that I continued to instruct in the French
language during the whole year.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the present academical
year, I proposed the name of a French
gentleman, and this nomination was laid by the
President before your honorable body. No appointment,
however, was made; but on the contrary
a vote was passed, requiring the Smith
Professor to instruct all the French classes for
the future.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, Gentlemen, call in question
your right to modify the duties of my Professorship;
and I have proceeded to organize
the classes, and commence the instruction in the
Elements of the French language, agreeably to
<span id="pg_153" class="page_anchor">153 </span>your vote. But I still entertain the [hope]
that a different arrangement, and one more in
harmony with the intent of a Professorship of
Belles Lettres, and more advantageous to the
University, may yet be made. The symmetry
and completeness of the Department are at present
destroyed. The organization introduced by
Mr. Ticknor, and continued successfully to the
great honor of the University is broken up. The
French language has no native teacher. And I
submit to you, Gentlemen, whether depriving the
Department of the services of such a teacher will
not justly be regarded by the public as lessening
the advantages of a residence at the University.</p>

<p>I have now under my charge 115 students in
French, and 30 in German. Of course, with so
many pupils my time is fully occupied. I can
exercise but little superintendence over the Department;
and have no leisure for the prosecution
of those studies, which are absolutely requisite
for the proper discharge of the duties originally
prescribed to me. When the labor of
mastering the Literature of even a single nation
is considered,—the utter impossibility of my
accomplishing anything, under the present arrangement,—in
the various fields of Foreign
Literature, over which my Professorship ranges,
will be at once apparent. An object of greater
importance is clearly sacrificed to one of less. I
<span id="pg_154" class="page_anchor">154 </span>am required to withdraw from those literary
studies and instructions, which had been originally
marked out for me, and to devote my
time to Elementary Instruction. Now if my
labors are of any importance to the College it is
to the former class of duties, that the importance
belongs. The latter can be performed as
well, perhaps better, by an instructor, employed
and paid in the usual way. In point of fact,
my office as Professor of Belles Lettres is almost
annihilated, and I have become merely a teacher
of French. To remedy this, Gentlemen, I make
to you the following propositions:—</p>

<p>I. That I should be wholly separated from
the Department of Modern Languages, and be
only Professor of Belles Lettres.</p>

<p>II. That I should reside, as now, in Cambridge.</p>

<p>III. That I should not be a member of the
Faculty.</p>

<p>IV. That my duties be confined to lecturing
during the Autumn Term; and the rest of the
year be at my own disposal, as in the case of the
Professor of History.</p>

<p>V. In consideration of which I relinquish
one half of my present income from the College,
and receive only one thousand dollars per annum.
Respectfully submitted, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<span id="pg_155" class="page_anchor">155 </span>

<p>The committee to which was referred the
memorial of Professor Longfellow reports:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p>That in conformity with his wishes, one of
two modifications of his existing duties may be
admitted consistently with the interest of the
University, both being predicated upon the plan
of substituting a native of France as a principal
teacher of the French language.</p>

<p>1. That Professor Longfellow’s services should
be limited to public lectures and oral instruction
&amp; relief from all other teaching, &amp; to continue
the general superintendence of the Department
and to continue his lectures both terms and
receive a salary of One Thousand dollars.</p>

<p>2. That he perform the above and give instruction
by hearing recitations of the advance
Classes in French, in both terms, and also of
all the surplus of the Students in French, when
their numbers shall exceed One Hundred &amp; to
receive a salary of Fifteen hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The committee submit it to the wisdom of the
board, which of these modifications is preferable.</p>

<p>At a later period came the following:—</p>

<p><span class="salutation">Gentlemen</span>,—I am reluctantly compelled
by the state of my health to ask leave of absence
<span id="pg_156" class="page_anchor">156 </span>from the College for six months from

to visit Germany, to try the effect of certain
baths, by means of which, as well as by the
relaxation and the sea-voyage, I hope to reëstablish
my health. My medical attendant advises
this course as more efficacious than any
treatment I can receive at home.</p>

<p>I shall be able, before leaving, to deliver all
the lectures of the Spring Term; and on my
return in November, those of the Autumn Term
before its close; and it is in reference to the
necessary arrangements for this, that I make
thus early my application for leave of absence.
The general supervision of the Department will
be undertaken by Professor Felton, without any
charge to the College;—the classes will lose
none of their lectures;—and I trust the interests
of the College will not suffer.</p>

my health is the sole reason of my making this
request.</p>

<span id="pg_157" class="page_anchor">157 </span>

<p>He sailed on April 23, 1842, and although his
health gained during the summer, was yet obliged
to ask for an extension of time, as follows:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Marienberg</span>, September 3, 1842.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Sir</span> [Hon. Josiah Quincy],—When
I left you in the Spring, I thought by this time I
should have recovered my health and be setting
my face homeward. In this I have been disappointed.
My recovery has been slower than I
expected; and though considerably better than
when I arrived here, I am yet far from being
well. The Doctor urges me very strongly to
remain longer. He thinks it of the utmost importance
to my future health, for years to come,
that I should do so. He says, that if I look forward
to a life of intellectual labor, in his opinion
“it is <em>absolutely necessary</em> I should give up all
thought of returning home before next Summer,
devoting the time to reëstablishing my health,
and avoiding all severe study.” I quote these
words from a written opinion which he gave me
this morning; and in consequence of which I
have determined to ask leave of absence until
that time, unless the state of my department in
College should absolutely demand my return.</p>

<p>I assure you, that I do this with the greatest
reluctance. I have no desire to remain here; on
the contrary a very strong desire to be at home
<span id="pg_158" class="page_anchor">158 </span>and at work. Still I wish to return in good
health and spirits, and not to lead a maimed life.
I fear, and the physician positively asserts, that
if I go back now I shall thwart the whole object
of my journey, and that if I hope to be well I
<em>must</em> go on with the baths.</p>

<p>I have therefore concluded to remain here
until I receive an answer from you; promising
myself that when I once escape from this hospital
I will never enter another until that final one
appointed for all the poets.</p>

<p>Will you have the goodness to say to your
daughter, Miss Quincy, that I left her package
for M<sup>r</sup>. Graham at its address in Havre; and
presume it reached him safely. In coming
through France it was not in my power to go
into Brittany, and avail myself of your letter of
introduction to him; the place of his residence
lying too far out of my route. From Paris I
came through Belgium to this ancient city of
Boppard, where I have remained stationary since
the first of June.</p>

<p>With kind remembrances to Mrs. Quincy and
your family,</p>

water spirit has announced that another year is
required in order to obtain the full benefit of his
draughts and ablutions. The fact is a source of
great sorrow to your friends and of no less embarrassment
to the Corporation of the College.
The granting the leave of six months’ absence
was effected, not without difficulty. Doubts
were expressed concerning the possibility of your
realizing your expectations, within the period you
specified; and the objections were surmounted
only on your assurance that you would return in
October, and that the benefit of your instructions
should not be lost, by any [class] of the
college, according to the arrangements you made.
It was on this fact, and on this assurance alone,
that assent of the Corporation was obtained. By
the proposition you now make the present Senior
class will be deprived of the advantages, on which
they have a right to calculate and have been
taught to expect.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances of the case, the Corporation
do not feel themselves willing absolutely
<span id="pg_160" class="page_anchor">160 </span>to withhold their assent to your protracting
your absence as you propose; at the same
time they are compelled by their sense of duty
&amp; I am authorized to state, that they, regarding
themselves, not as proprietors, but as trustees, of
the funds under their control, cannot deem themselves
justified in paying the salary of the Professorship
to a Professor, not resident &amp; not
performing its duties. They value your services
very highly, and are therefore willing, if you see
fit to remain another year in Europe, to keep
the Professorship open for your return; but I
am directed to say that, in such case, your salary
must cease, at the end of the current quarter—viz.
on the 30 of November next.</p>

<p>The obligation thus imposed on the Corporation,
it is very painful to them to fulfil, but they
cannot otherwise execute the trust they have
undertaken, conformably to their sense of duty.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, permit me to express my best
wishes for your health; the high sense I entertain
of your talents and attainments and the unaltered
esteem &amp; respect with which I am, most

<p>Longfellow spent his summer at the water-cure
in Marienberg, with some diverging trips, as
those to Paris, Antwerp, and Bruges. In Paris
he took a letter to Jules Janin, now pretty well
forgotten, but then the foremost critic in Paris,
who disliked the society of literary men, saying
that he never saw them and never wished to see
them; and who had quarrelled personally with
all the French authors, except Lamartine, whom
he pronounced “as good as an angel.” In Bruges
the young traveller took delight in the belfry,
and lived to transmit some of its charms to others.
At Antwerp he had the glories of the cathedral,
the memory of Quintin Matsys, and the paintings
of Rubens. His home at Marienberg was
in an ancient cloister for noble nuns, converted
into a water-cure, then a novelty and much
severer in its discipline than its later copies in
America, to one of which, however, Longfellow
himself went later as a patient,—that of Dr.
Wesselhoeft at Brattleboro, Vermont. He met
or read German poets also,—Becker, Herwegh,
Lenau, Auersberg, Zedlitz, and Freiligrath, with
the latter of whom he became intimate; indeed
reading aloud to admiring nuns his charming
poem about “The Flowers’ Revenge” (<em>Der Blumen
Rache</em>). He just missed seeing Uhland,
the only German poet then more popular than
Freiligrath; he visited camps of 50,000 troops
<span id="pg_162" class="page_anchor">162 </span>and another camp of naturalists at Mayence.
Meantime, he heard from Prescott, Sumner, and
Felton at home; the “Spanish Student” went
through the press, and his friend Hawthorne
was married. He finally sailed for home on
October 22, 1842, and occupied himself on the
voyage in writing a small volume of poems on
slavery.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-14">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<span class="title">ANTI-SLAVERY POEMS AND SECOND MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">It</span> is difficult now to realize what an event in
Longfellow’s life was the fact of his writing a
series of anti-slavery poems on board ship and
publishing them in a thin pamphlet on his return.
Parties on the subject were already strongly
drawn; the anti-slavery party being itself divided
into subdivisions which criticised each
other sharply. Longfellow’s temperament was
thoroughly gentle and shunned extremes, so that
the little thin yellow-covered volume came upon
the community with something like a shock. As
a matter of fact, various influences had led him
up to it. His father had been a subscriber to
Benjamin Lundy’s “Genius of Universal Emancipation,”
the precursor of Garrison’s “Liberator.”
In his youth at Brunswick, Longfellow
had thought of writing a drama on the subject
of “Toussaint l’Ouverture,” his reason for it
being thus given, “that thus I may do something
in my humble way for the great cause
of negro emancipation.”</p>

<p>Margaret Fuller, who could by no means be
<span id="pg_164" class="page_anchor">164 </span>called an abolitionist, described the volume as
“the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow’s thin books;
spirited and polished like its forerunners; but
the subject would warrant a deeper tone.” On
the other hand, the editors of “Graham’s Magazine”
wrote to Mr. Longfellow that “the word
slavery was never allowed to appear in a Philadelphia
periodical,” and that “the publisher objected
to have even the name of the book appear
in his pages.” His friend Samuel Ward, always
an agreeable man of the world, wrote from
New York of the poems, “They excite a good deal
of attention and sell rapidly. I have sent one
copy to the South and others shall follow,” and
includes Longfellow among “you abolitionists.”
The effect of the poems was unquestionably to
throw him on the right side of the great moral
contest then rising to its climax, while he incurred,
like his great compeers, Channing, Emerson, and
Sumner, some criticism from the pioneers.
Such differences are inevitable among reformers,
whose internal contests are apt to be more strenuous
and formidable than those incurred between
opponents; and recall to mind that remark of
Cosmo de Medici which Lord Bacon called “a
desperate saying;” namely, that “Holy Writ
bids us to forgive our enemies, but it is nowhere
enjoined upon us that we should forgive our
friends.”</p>

<span id="pg_165" class="page_anchor">165 </span>

<p>To George Lunt, a poet whose rhymes Longfellow
admired, but who bitterly opposed the
anti-slavery movement, he writes his programme
as follows:—</p>

<p>“I am sorry you find so much to gainsay
in my Poems on Slavery. I shall not argue the
point with you, however, but will simply state to
you my belief.</p>

<p>“1. I believe slavery to be an unrighteous
institution, based on the false maxim that Might
makes Right.</p>

<p>“2. I have great faith in doing what is righteous,
and fear no evil consequences.</p>

<p>“3. I believe that every one has a perfect
right to express his opinion on the subject of
Slavery, as on every other thing; that every one
ought so to do, until the public opinion of all
Christendom shall penetrate into and change the
hearts of the Southerners on this subject.</p>

<p>“4. I would have no other <em>interference</em> than
what is sanctioned by law.</p>

<p>“5. I believe that where there is a <em>will</em> there is
a <em>way</em>. When the whole country sincerely wishes
to get rid of Slavery, it will readily find the means.</p>

<p>“6. Let us, therefore, do all we can to bring
about this <em>will</em>, in all gentleness and Christian
charity.</p>

<p>“And God speed the time!”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_61" id="fnc_61">[61]</a></p>

<span id="pg_166" class="page_anchor">166 </span>

<p>Mr. Longfellow was, I think, not quite justly
treated by the critics, or even by his latest biographer,
Professor Carpenter,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_62" id="fnc_62">[62]</a> for consenting to
the omission of the anti-slavery poems from his
works, published by Carey and Hart in Philadelphia
in November, 1845. This was an illustrated
edition which had been for some time
in preparation and did not apparently, like the
nearly simultaneous edition of Harper, assume to
contain his complete works. The Harper edition
was published in February, 1846, in cheaper form
and double columns, and was the really collective
edition, containing the anti-slavery poems and
all. As we do not know the circumstances of
the case, it cannot positively be asserted why this
variation occurred, but inasmuch as the Harpers
were at that period, and for many years after,
thoroughly conservative on the slavery question
and extremely opposed to referring to it in
any way, it is pretty certain that it must have
been because of the positive demand of Longfellow
that these poems were included by them.
The criticism of the abolitionists on him was undoubtedly
strengthened by the apostrophe to
the Union at the close of his poem, “The Building
of the Ship,” in 1850, a passage which was
described by William Lloyd Garrison in the
“Liberator” as “a eulogy dripping with the
<span id="pg_167" class="page_anchor">167 </span>blood of imbruted humanity,”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_63" id="fnc_63">[63]</a> and was quite as
severely viewed by one of the most zealous of
the Irish abolitionists, who thus wrote to their
friends in Boston:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Dublin [Ireland]</span>, April 28, 1850.
</div>

<p>[After speaking about Miss Weston’s displeasure
with Whittier and her being unfair to
him, etc., the letter adds—]</p>

<p>Is it not a poor thing for Longfellow that he
is no abolitionist—that his anti-slavery poetry
is perfect dish water beside Whittier’s—and
that he has just penned a Pæan on the Union?
I can no more comprehend what there is in
the Union to make the Yankee nation adore it—than
you can understand the attractions of
Royalty &amp; Aristocracy which thousands of very
good people in England look on as the source
&amp; mainstay of all that is great and good in the
nation....</p>

</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet Mr. Whittier himself, though thus contrasted
with Longfellow, had written thanking
him for his “Poems on Slavery,” which in tract
form, he said, “had been of important service
to the Liberty movement.” Whittier had also
asked whether Longfellow would accept a nomination
<span id="pg_168" class="page_anchor">168 </span>to Congress from the Liberty Party, and
had added, “Our friends think they could throw
for thee one thousand more votes than for any
other man.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_65" id="fnc_65">[65]</a> Nor was Whittier himself ever
a disunionist, even on anti-slavery grounds.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that it was apparently
the anti-slavery question which laid the foundation
for the intimacy between Longfellow and
Lowell. Lowell had been invited, on the publication
of “A Year’s Life,” to write for an annual
which was to appear in Boston and to be edited,
in Lowell’s own phrase, “by Longfellow, Felton,
Hillard and that set.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_66" id="fnc_66">[66]</a> Lowell subsequently
wrote in the “Pioneer” kindly notices of Longfellow’s
“Poems on Slavery,” but there is no
immediate evidence of any personal relations
between them at that time. In a letter to Poe,
dated at Elmwood June 27, 1844, Lowell says of a
recent article in the “Foreign Quarterly Review”
attributed to John Forster, “Forster is a friend
of some of the Longfellow clique here, which
perhaps accounts for his putting L. at the top
of our Parnassus. These kinds of arrangements
do very well, however, for the present.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_67" id="fnc_67">[67]</a>...
It will be noticed that what Lowell had originally
called a “set” has now become a “clique.”
<span id="pg_169" class="page_anchor">169 </span>It is also evident that lie did not regard Longfellow
as the assured head of the American
Parnassus, and at any rate he suggests some
possible rearrangement for the future. Their
real friendship seems to have begun with a
visit by Longfellow to Lowell’s study on October
29, 1846, when the conversation turned
chiefly on the slavery question. Longfellow
called to see him again on the publication of his
second volume of poems, at the end of the following
year, and Lowell spent an evening with
Longfellow during March, 1848, while engaged
on “The Fable for Critics,” in which the younger
poet praised the elder so warmly.</p>

<p>Longfellow’s own state of mind at this period
is well summed up in the following letter to his
wife’s younger sister, Mrs. Peter Thacher, then
recently a mother.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, Feb. 15, 1843.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Margaret</span>,—I was very much
gratified by your brief epistle, which reached
me night before last, and brought me the assurances
of your kind remembrance. Believe me,
I have often thought of you and your husband;
and have felt that your new home, though remote
from many of your earlier friends, was nevertheless
to you the centre of a world of happiness.
With your affection, and your “young Astyanax,”
<span id="pg_170" class="page_anchor">170 </span>the “yellow house” becomes a golden
palace.</p>

<p>For my part, Life seems to be to me “a battle
and a march.” I am sometimes well,—sometimes
ill, and always restless. My late expedition
to Germany did me a vast deal of good;
and my health is better than it has been for
years. So long as I keep out of doors and take
exercise enough, I feel perfectly well. So soon
as I shut myself up and begin to study, I feel
perfectly ill. Thus the Sphinx’s riddle—the
secret of health—is discovered. In Germany
I led an out-of-door life; bathing and walking
from morning till night. I was at Boppard on
the Rhine, in the old convent of Marienberg,
now a Bathing establishment. I travelled a little
in Germany; then passed through Belgium
to England. In London I staid with Dickens;
and had a very pleasant visit. His wife is a
gentle, lovely character; and he has four children,
all beautiful and good. I saw likewise <em>the</em> raven,
who is stuffed in the entry—and his successor,
who stalks gravely in the garden.</p>

<p>I am very sorry, my dear Margaret, that I
cannot grant your request in regard to Mary’s
Journal. Just before I sailed for Europe, being
in low spirits, and reflecting on the uncertainties
of such an expedition as I was then beginning,
I burned a great many letters and private papers,
<span id="pg_171" class="page_anchor">171 </span>and among them this. I now regret it; but
alas! too late.</p>

<p>Ah! my dear Margaret! though somewhat
wayward and restless, I most affectionately
cherish the memory of my wife. You know
how happily we lived together; and <em>I</em> know
that never again shall I be loved with such devotion,
sincerity, and utter forgetfulness of self.
Make her your model, and you will make your
husband ever happy; and be to him as a household
lamp irradiating his darkest hours.</p>

<p>Give my best regards to him. I should like
very much to visit you; but know not how I
can bring it about. Kiss “young Astyanax”
for me, and believe me ever affectionately your
brother</p>

<p>Meanwhile a vast change in his life was approaching.
He had met, seven years before in
Switzerland, a maiden of nineteen, Frances
Elizabeth Appleton, daughter of Nathan Appleton,
a Boston merchant; and though his early
sketch of her in “Hyperion” may have implied
little on either side, it was fulfilled at any rate,
after these years of acquaintance, by her consenting;
to become his wife, an event which took
place on the 13th of July, 1843, and was thus
announced by him in a letter to Miss Eliza
<span id="pg_172" class="page_anchor">172 </span>A. Potter of Portland, his first wife’s elder
sister.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, May 25, 1843.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Eliza</span>,—I have been meaning for
a week or more to write you in order to tell you
of my engagement, and to ask your sympathies
and good wishes. But I have been so much occupied,
and have had so many letters to write,
to go by the last steamers, that I have been rather
neglectful of some of my nearer and dearer
friends; trusting to their kindness for my excuse.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear Eliza, I am to be married again.
My life was too lonely and restless;—I needed
the soothing influences of a home;—and I have
chosen a person for my wife who possesses in a
high degree those virtues and excellent traits of
character, which so distinguished my dear Mary.
Think not, that in this new engagement, I do any
wrong to her memory. I still retain, and ever
shall preserve with sacred care all my cherished
recollections of her truth, affection and beautiful
nature. And I feel, that could she speak to me,
she would approve of what I am doing. I hope
also for your approval and for your father’s....

<span id="pg_173" class="page_anchor">173 </span>

<p>The lady thus described was one who lives in
the memory of all who knew her, were it only by
her distinguished appearance and bearing, her
“deep, unutterable eyes,” in Longfellow’s own
phrase, and her quiet, self-controlled face illumined
by a radiant smile. She was never better
described, perhaps, than by the Hungarian,
Madame Pulszky, who visited America with
Kossuth, and who wrote of her as “a lady of
Junonian beauty and of the kindest heart.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_69" id="fnc_69">[69]</a>
Promptly and almost insensibly she identified
herself with all her husband’s work, a thing
rendered peculiarly valuable from the fact that
his eyes had become overstrained, so that he
welcomed an amanuensis. Sometimes she suggested
subjects for poems, this being at least
the case with “The Arsenal at Springfield,”
first proposed by her within the very walls of the
building, a spot whose moral was doubtless enhanced
by the companionship of Charles Sumner,
just then the especial prophet of international
peace. She also aided him effectually in
his next book, “The Poets and Poetry of Europe,”
in which his friend Felton also coöperated,
he preparing the biographical notices while
Longfellow made the selections and also some of
the translations.</p>

<p>I add this letter from his betrothed, which
<span id="pg_174" class="page_anchor">174 </span>strikes the reader as singularly winning and
womanly. This also is addressed to the elder
sister of the first Mrs. Longfellow.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="salutation">Dear Miss Potter</span>,—Accept my warmest
thanks for the very kind manner in which you
have expressed an interest in our happiness. It
is all the more welcome in coming from a stranger
upon whom I have no past claim to kindle a
kindly regard, and touches my heart deeply.
Among the many blessings which the new world
I have entered reveals to me, a new heritage
of friends is a choice one. Those most dear
to Henry, most closely linked with his early
associations, I am, naturally, most anxious to
know and love,—and I trust an opportunity
will bring us together before long.</p>

<p>But I should feel no little timidity in being
known to you and his family; a dread that loving
him as you do I might not fulfil all the
exactions of your hearts; were not such fears
relieved by the generous determination you have
shown to approve his choice,—upon faith in
<em>him</em>. To one who has known him so long and
so well, I need not attempt to speak of my happiness
in possessing such a heart,—nor of my
infinite gratitude to the Giver of every good gift
for bestowing upon me the power of rendering
<span id="pg_175" class="page_anchor">175 </span>him once more happy in the hope of a home,—so
sacred and dear to his loving nature by blessed
memories to which I fervently pray to be found
worthy to succeed.</p>

<p>Receive again my thanks for your kind sympathy,
with the assurance of my warm regards,—which
I trust will not always be imprisoned in
words, and with kindest remembrances to my

<p>It is pleasant to record in connection with this
sweet and high-minded letter, that a copy of
“Hyperion” itself lies before me which is inscribed
on the first page in pencil to “Miss
Eliza A. Potter, from her affectionate friend
and brother, the Author.” That he preserved
through life a warm friendliness toward all the
kindred of his first wife is quite certain.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-15">CHAPTER XV<br>

<span class="title">ACADEMIC LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">There</span> exists abundant evidence, to which the
present writer can add personal testimony, in
regard to Longfellow’s success as an organizer
of his immediate department of Harvard University
and in dealing with his especial classes.
He was assigned, for some reason, a room in
University Hall which was also employed for
faculty meetings, and was therefore a little
less dreary than the ordinary class-room of those
days. It seemed most appropriate that an instructor
of Longfellow’s well-bred aspect and
ever-courteous manners should simply sit at the
head of the table with his scholars, as if they
were guests, instead of putting between him and
them the restrictive demarcation of a teacher’s
desk. We read with him, I remember, first the
little book he edited, “Proverbes Dramatiques,”
and afterwards something of Racine and Molière,
in which his faculty of finding equivalent
phrases was an admirable example for us. When
afterwards, during an abortive rebellion in the
college yard, the students who had refused to
<span id="pg_177" class="page_anchor">177 </span>listen to others yielded to the demand of their
ringleader, “Let us hear Professor Longfellow;
he always treats us like gentlemen,” the youthful
rebel unconsciously recognized a step forward
in academical discipline. Longfellow did
not cultivate us much personally, or ask us to
his house, but he remembered us and acknowledged
our salutations. He was, I think, the
first Harvard instructor who addressed the individual
student with the prefix “Mr.” I recall
the clearness of his questions, the simplicity of
his explanations, the well-bred and skilful propriety
with which he led us past certain indiscreet
phrases in our French authors, as for instance
in Balzac’s “Peau de Chagrin.” Most
of all comes back to memory the sense of triumph
with which we saw the proof-sheets of
“Voices of the Night” brought in by the printer’s
devil and laid at his elbow. We felt that
we also had lived in literary society, little dreaming,
in our youthful innocence, how large a part
of such society would prove far below the standard
of courtesy that prevailed in Professor
Longfellow’s recitation room.</p>

<p>Yet the work of this room was, in those days
of dawning changes, but a small part of the
function of a professor. Longfellow was, both
by inclination and circumstances, committed to
the reform initiated by his predecessor, George
<span id="pg_178" class="page_anchor">178 </span>Ticknor. He had inherited from this predecessor
a sort of pioneership in position relative to
the elective system just on trial as an experiment
in college. There exists an impression in
some quarters that this system came in for the
first time under President Walker about 1853;
but it had been, as a matter of fact, tried much
earlier,—twenty years, at least,—in the Modern
Language Department under Ticknor, and
had been extended much more widely in 1839 under
President Quincy. The facts are well known
to me, as I was in college at that period and enjoyed
the beneficent effects of the change, since
it placed the whole college, in some degree, for a
time at least, on a university basis. The change
took the form, first, of a discontinuance of mathematics
as a required study after the first year,
and then the wider application of the elective
system in history, natural history, and the classics,
this greater liberty being enjoyed, though
with some reaction, under President Everett,
and practically abolished about 1849 under President
Sparks, when what may be called the High
School system was temporarily restored. An
illustration of this reactionary tendency may be
found in a letter addressed by Longfellow to the
President and Fellows, placing him distinctly on
the side of freedom of choice. The circumstances
are these: Students had for some time been
<span id="pg_179" class="page_anchor">179 </span>permitted to take more than one modern language
among the electives, and I myself, before
receiving my degree of A. B. in 1841, had studied
two such languages simultaneously for three
years of college course. It appears, however,
from the following letter, that this privilege had
already been reduced to one such language, and
that Longfellow was at once found remonstrating
against it, though at first ineffectually.</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, June 24, 1845.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">Gentlemen</span>,—In arranging the studies for
the next year, the Faculty have voted, as will
be seen from the enclosed Tabular view, that
“no student will be allowed to take more than
one Modern Language at a time, except for special
reasons assigned, &amp; by express vote of the
Faculty.”</p>

<p>You will see that this is the only Department
upon which any bar or prohibition is laid. And
when the decision was made, the Latin &amp; Greek
Departments were allowed two votes each, &amp;
the Department of Modern Languages but one
vote.</p>

<p>As I foresaw at the time, this arrangement
has proved very disadvantageous to the Department,
&amp; has reduced the number of pupils, at
once, more than one half. During this year the
whole number of students in the Department
<span id="pg_180" class="page_anchor">180 </span>has been 224. The applications for the next
term do not amount to 100; nor, when all have
been received, can it reach 110. I therefore,
Gentlemen, appeal to you, for your interference
in this matter, requesting that the restriction
may be removed, &amp; this Department put upon
the footing of the others in this particular.
Otherwise, I fear that as at present organized,

desiring that the restriction as to the number of
modern languages that may be studied at once

with the other members of the Corporation
already considered the general subject of the
<span id="pg_181" class="page_anchor">181 </span>arrangement of the studies of the undergraduates,
with especial reference to the recommendations
of the board of overseers; &amp; that they
were convinced by the examination of the details
they made at that time that the business of
ordering the times &amp; the amount of study &amp;
recitation for the young men at Cambridge is
not only a very complicated &amp; difficult affair,
but one which is in the hands of those best
qualified, &amp; considering all their relations, most
truly interested to lead the students to give as
much labor as is safe for them to the studies
suitable to College years, &amp; to distribute it in
such manner as shall be most just &amp; effective.
The committee would not feel themselves authorized
to change one part of a system, all the
parts of which are intricately dependent upon
each other, without they felt a confidence they do
not possess that they could recommend one which
should work better as a whole. They therefore
must decline, so far as depends upon them,
adopting a measure the ulterior effects of which
they may not foresee with accuracy, &amp; they
express the belief that it will be well to allow
the present arrangement to continue for a time,
even at the risk, apprehended by Prof<sup>r</sup>. Longfellow,
of its producing an injurious effect upon
his department. They cannot but hope, however,
that the evils he fears may be avoided, or

<p>A year later than the above correspondence,
the subject was evidently revived on the part
of the governing powers of the College, and we
find the following letter from Professor Longfellow:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Cambridge</span>, Sept. 25, 1846.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">Dear Sir</span>,—In answer to your favor of the
18th inst. requesting my opinion on certain
points connected with the Studies of the University,
I beg leave to state;</p>

<p>I. In regard to the “advantages and disadvantages
of the Elective System.” In my own
department I have always been strongly in favor
of this system. I have always thought that the
modern languages should be among the voluntary
or elective studies and form no part of the
required Academic course. As to the Latin and
<ins title="Note: “Greek.” in the original">Greek</ins> I have many doubts; but incline rather
to the old system, particularly if the fifth class
can be added to the present course; for we could
then secure the advantages of both systems.</p>

<p>II. The class examinations in my department
are very slight and unsatisfactory. They
serve however as a kind of Annual Report of
<span id="pg_183" class="page_anchor">183 </span>what has been done in the department; and as
there is nothing depending upon them, it does
not seem to me a matter of very urgent necessity
to have them rendered more thorough.</p>

<p>III. “The Fifth class or New Department
in the University” seems to me of the greatest
importance, as it would enable us to carry forward
the studies of each department much
farther than at present, by means of Lectures,
for which there is now hardly sufficient opportunity.
Last year there were fifteen Resident
Graduates. Why should not these have formed
the Fifth Class?</p>

<p>IV. In regard to the “practical working of
any other of the changes made in our system
during the last twenty years,” I can hardly
claim any distinct views. Many, perhaps most
of them were made before I came to the University;
so that I hardly know what is old and
what is new.</p>

<p>I have made but a brief statement in answer
to your enquiries, partly because writing is a
painful process with me, and partly because
many things here touched upon can be more
clearly explained <em>vive voce</em> than with the pen.</p>

<span id="pg_184" class="page_anchor">184 </span>

<p>It is a curious fact that more than half a
century later, at a meeting of the American Modern
Language Association, held at the very institution
where this correspondence took place, it
was President Charles William Eliot, son of the
author of the letter just quoted, who recognized
the immense advance made in this particular
department as one of the most important steps
in the progress of the University. His remarks
were thus reported in the Boston “Herald” of
December 27, 1901:—</p>

<p>“When the meeting opened yesterday afternoon
President Eliot was present and graciously
said a few words of welcome. He said that he
knew of no body of modern learned men whom
he would be so glad to welcome as the professors
of language.</p>

<p>“‘Here at Harvard,’ he said, ‘we have been
pressing forward for many years toward the same
object you have in view. I congratulate you
upon the great progress made in the last thirty
years. One of the most striking features of
American education has been the rapid development
of the study of languages. It has been
more rapid at some of the other colleges than
at Harvard. They started at nothing a shorter
time ago. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>“‘You are to be congratulated upon the
cohesion which exists among learned men in
<span id="pg_185" class="page_anchor">185 </span>dealing with this important subject. The study
of modern languages is beginning to connect
itself with the life of the nation. It now bears
a real connection to national life and interest.
No great subject in educational thought ever
obtained a firm hold that had not some modern
connection with the day. I do not overlook the
literary element in the study of modern languages,
but you will have a stronger hold for
the next twenty years than you have in the past,
owing to this use of modern languages in daily
life, incident to the industrial and commercial
activity of the country.’”</p>

<p>It is always to be borne in mind that Longfellow’s
self-restrained and well-ordered temperament
habitually checked him in the career of
innovator. Both in public and private matters,
it was his way to state his point of view and then
await results. It is clear that his mental habit,
his foreign experience, and the traditions of his
immediate department predisposed him to favor
the elective system in university training. This
system, after temporary trial and abandonment,
was now being brought forward once more and
was destined this time to prevail. Towards this
success, the prosperity of the Modern Language
Department formed a perpetual argument, because
it was there that the reform was first introduced.
The records of the Faculty at that
<span id="pg_186" class="page_anchor">186 </span>period give very little information as to the
attitude of individual professors, and Longfellow
may be viewed as having been for the most part
a silent reformer. One finds, however, constant
evidence in his diaries of the fact that his duties
wore upon him. “I get very tired of the routine
of this life.” “This college work is like a
great hand laid on all the strings of my lyre,
stopping their vibrations.” “How the days
resemble each other and how sad it is to me that
I cannot give them all to my poem.” “I have
fallen into a very unpoetic mood and cannot
write.” It must be remembered that his eyes
were at this time very weak, that he suffered
extremely from neuralgia, and that these entries
were all made during the great fugitive slave excitement
which agitated New England, and the
political overturn in Massachusetts which culminated
in the election of the poet’s most intimate
friend, Sumner, to the United States Senate.
He records the occurrence of his forty-fourth
birthday, and soon after when he is stereotyping
the “Golden Legend” he says: “I still work a
good deal upon it,” but also writes, only two
days after, “Working hard with college classes
to have them ready for their examinations.” A
fortnight later he says: “Examination in my
department; always to me a day of anguish
and exhaustion.” His correspondence is very
<span id="pg_187" class="page_anchor">187 </span>large; visitors and dinner parties constantly increase.
His mother dies suddenly, and he sits
all night alone by her dead body; a sense of
peace comes over him, as if there had been no
shock or jar in nature, but a “harmonious close
to a long life.” Later he gets tired of summer
rest at Nahant, which he calls “building up life
with solid blocks of idleness;” but when two
days later he goes back to Cambridge to resume
his duties, he records: “I felt my neck bow and
the pressure of the yoke.” Soon after he says:
“I find no time to write. I find more and more
the little things of life shut out the great. Innumerable
interruptions—letters of application
for this and for that; endless importunities of
foreigners for help here and help there—fret the
day and consume it.” He often records having
half a dozen men to dine with him; he goes to
the theatre, to lectures, concerts, and balls, has no
repose, and perhaps, as we have seen at Nahant,
would not really enjoy it. It was under these
conditions, however, that the “Golden Legend”
came into the world in November, 1851; and
it was not until September 12, 1854, that its
author was finally separated from the University.
He was before that date happily at work
on “Hiawatha.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-16">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<span class="title">LITERARY LIFE IN CAMBRIDGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Let</span> us now return from the history of Longfellow’s
academic life to his normal pursuit, literature.
It seemed a curious transition from
the real and genuine sympathy for human wrong,
as shown in the “Poems on Slavery,” to the
purely literary and historic quality of the “Spanish
Student” (1843), a play never quite dramatic
enough to be put on the stage, at least in English,
though a German version was performed
at the Ducal Court Theatre in Dessau, January
28, 1855. As literary work it was certainly
well done; though taken in part from the tale of
Cervantes “La Gitanilla,” and handled before
by Montalvan and by Solis in Spanish, and by
Middleton in English, it yet was essentially
Longfellow’s own in treatment, though perhaps
rather marred by taking inappropriately the
motto from Robert Burns. He wrote of it to
Samuel Ward in New York, December, 1840,
calling it “something still longer which as yet
no eye but mine has seen and which I wish to
read to you first.” He then adds, “At present,
<span id="pg_189" class="page_anchor">189 </span>my dear friend, my soul is wrapped up in poetry.
The scales fell from my eyes suddenly, and I
beheld before me a beautiful landscape, with
figures, which I have transferred to paper almost
without an effort, and with a celerity of which I
did not think myself capable. Since my return
from Portland I am almost afraid to look at it,
for fear its colors should have faded out. And
this is the reason why I do not describe the work
to you more particularly. I am not sure it is
worth it. You shall yourself see and judge before
long.” He thus afterwards describes it to
his father: “I have also written a much longer
and more difficult poem, called ‘The Spanish
Student,’—a drama in five acts; on the success
of which I rely with some self-complacency. But
this is a great secret, and must not go beyond
the immediate family circle; as I do not intend
to publish it until the glow of composition has
passed away, and I can look upon it coolly and
critically. I will tell you more of this by and
by.”</p>

<p>Longfellow’s work on “The Poets and Poetry
of Europe” appeared in 1845, and was afterwards
reprinted with a supplement in 1871.
The original work included 776 pages,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_74" id="fnc_74">[74]</a> the supplement
adding 340 more. The supplement is
<span id="pg_190" class="page_anchor">190 </span>in some respects better edited than the original,
because it gives the names of the translators, and
because he had some better translators to draw
upon, especially Rossetti. It can be said fairly
of the whole book that it is intrinsically one of
the most attractive of a very unattractive class,
a book of which the compiler justly says that, in
order to render the literary history of the various
countries complete, “an author of no great note
has sometimes been admitted, or a poem which
a severer taste would have excluded.” “The
work is to be regarded,” he adds, “as a collection,
rather than as a selection, and in judging
any author it must be borne in mind the translations
do not always preserve the rhythm and
melody of the original, but often resemble soldiers
moving forward when the music has ceased
and the time is marked only by the tap of the
drum.” It includes, in all, only ten languages,
the Celtic and Slavonic being excluded, as well
as the Turkish and Romaic, a thing which would
now seem strange. But the editor’s frank explanation
of the fact, where he says “with these
I am not acquainted,” disarms criticism. This
explanation implies that he was personally acquainted
with the six Gothic languages of Northern
Europe—Anglo-Saxon, Icelandish, Danish,
Swedish, German, and Dutch—and the four
Latin languages of the South of Europe—French,
<span id="pg_191" class="page_anchor">191 </span>Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The
mere work of compiling so large a volume in
double columns of these ten languages was something
formidable, and he had reason to be grateful
to his friend Professor Felton, who, being
a German student, as well as a Greek scholar,
compiled for him all the biographical notes in
the book. It is needless to say that the selection
is as good as the case permitted or as the plan
of the book allowed, and the volume has always
maintained its place of importance in libraries.
Many of the translations were made expressly for
it, especially in the supplement; among these
being Platen’s “Remorse,” Reboul’s “The Angel
and Child,” and Malherbe’s “Consolation.”
It is to be remembered that Longfellow’s standard
of translation was very high and that he
always maintained, according to Mrs. Fields, that
Americans, French, and Germans had a greater
natural gift for it than the English on account
of the greater insularity of the latter’s natures.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_75" id="fnc_75">[75]</a>
It is also to be noted that he sometimes failed
to find material for translation where others
found it, as, for instance, amid the endless beauty
of the Greek Anthology, which he called “the
most melancholy of books with an odor of dead
garlands about it. Voices from the grave, cymbals
of Bacchantes, songs of love, sighs, groans,
<span id="pg_192" class="page_anchor">192 </span>prayers,—all mingled together. I never read
a book that made me sadder.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_76" id="fnc_76">[76]</a></p>

<p>His fame at this time was widely established,
yet a curious indication of the fact that he did
not at once take even Cambridge by storm, as a
poet, is in a letter from Professor Andrews Norton,
father of the present Professor Charles E.
Norton, to the Rev. W. H. Furness of Philadelphia.
The latter had apparently applied to Mr.
Norton for advice as to a desirable list of American
authors from whom to make some literary
selections, perhaps in connection with an annual
then edited by him and called “The Diadem.”
Professor Norton, as one of the most cultivated
Americans, might naturally be asked for some
such counsel. In replying he sent Mr. Furness,
under date of January 7, 1845, a list of fifty-four
eligible authors, among whom Emerson stood
last but one, while Longfellow was not included
at all. He then appended a supplementary list
of twenty-four minor authors, headed by Longfellow.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_77" id="fnc_77">[77]</a>
We have already seen Lowell, from a
younger point of view, describing Longfellow, at
about this time, as the head of a “clique,” and
we now find Andrews Norton, from an older
point of view, assigning him only the first place
among authors of the second grade. It is curious
<span id="pg_193" class="page_anchor">193 </span>to notice, in addition, that Hawthorne stood next
to Longfellow in this subordinate roll.</p>

<p>Longfellow published two volumes of poetic
selections, “The Waif” (1845) and “The Estray”
(1846), the latter title being originally
planned as “Estrays in the Forest,” and he records
a visit to the college library, in apparent
search for the origin of the phrase. His next
volume of original poems, however, was “The
Belfry of Bruges and Other Poems,” published
December 23, 1845, the contents having already
been partly printed in “Graham’s Magazine,”
and most of them in the illustrated edition of his
poems published in Philadelphia. The theme of
the volume appears to have been partly suggested
by some words in a letter to Freiligrath which
seem to make the leading poem, together with
that called “Nuremberg,” a portion of that
projected series of travel-sketches which had
haunted Longfellow ever since “Outre-Mer.”
“The Norman Baron” was the result of a passage
from Thierry, sent him by an unknown correspondent.
One poem was suggested by a
passage in Andersen’s “Story of my Life,” and
one was written at Boppard on the Rhine. All
the rest were distinctly American in character
or origin. Another poem, “To the Driving
Cloud,” the chief of the Omaha Indians, was his
first effort at hexameters and prepared the way
<span id="pg_194" class="page_anchor">194 </span>for “Evangeline.” His translation of the “Children
of the Lord’s Supper” had also served by
way of preparation; and he had happened upon
a specimen in “Blackwood’s Magazine” of the
hexameter translation of the “Iliad” which
had impressed him very much. He even tried
a passage of “Evangeline” rendered into English
pentameter verse, and thus satisfied himself
that it was far less effective for his purpose than
the measure finally adopted.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the reading public at
large has confirmed the opinion of Dr. Oliver
Wendell Holmes when he says, “Of the longer
poems of our chief singer, I should not hesitate
to select <ins title="Note: with double quotes in the original">‘Evangeline’</ins> as the masterpiece, and
I think the general verdict of opinion would confirm
my choice.... From the first line of the
poem, from its first words, we read as we would
float down a broad and placid river, murmuring
softly against its banks, heaven over it, and the
glory of the unspoiled wilderness all around.”
The words “This is the forest primeval” have
become as familiar, he thinks, as the “Arma
virumque cano” which opened Virgil’s “Æneid,”
and he elsewhere calls the poem “the tranquil
current of these brimming, slow-moving, soul-satisfying
lines.” The subject was first suggested
to Longfellow by Hawthorne, who had heard it
from his friend, the Rev. H. L. Conolly, and the
<span id="pg_195" class="page_anchor">195 </span>outline of it will be found in “The American
Note-Books” of Hawthorne, who disappointed
Father Conolly by not using it himself. It was
finished on Longfellow’s fortieth birthday.</p>

<p>It was a striking illustration of the wide popularity
of “Evangeline,” that even the proper
names introduced under guidance of his rhythmical
ear spread to other countries and were taken
up and preserved as treasures in themselves.
Sumner writes from England to Longfellow that
the Hon. Mrs. Norton, herself well known in
literature, had read “Evangeline,” not once only,
but twenty times, and the scene on Lake Atchafalaya,
where the two lovers pass each other
unknowingly, so impressed her that she had a
seal cut with the name upon it. Not long after
this, Leopold, King of the <ins title="Note: the correct form would be “Belgians”, could be intentional or a common mistake">Belgiums</ins>, repeated
the same word to her and said that it was so suggestive
of scenes in human life that he was about
to have it cut on a seal, when she astonished him
by showing him hers.</p>

<p>The best review of “Evangeline” ever written
was probably the analysis made of it by that
accomplished French traveller of half a century
ago, Professor Philarète Chasles of the Collège
<ins title="Note: “Le” in the original">de</ins> France, in his “Etudes sur la Littérature
et les Mœurs des Anglo-Américains du XIX.
Siécle,” published in 1851. It is interesting to
read it, and to recognize anew what has often
<span id="pg_196" class="page_anchor">196 </span>been made manifest—the greater acuteness of
the French mind than of the English, when
discussing American themes. Writing at that
early period, M. Chasles at once recognized,
for instance, the peculiar quality of Emerson’s
genius. He describes Longfellow, in comparison,
as what he calls a moonlight poet, having
little passion, but a calmness of attitude which
approaches majesty, and moreover a deep sensibility,
making itself felt under a subdued rhythm.
In short, his is a slow melody and a reflective
emotion, both these being well suited to the
sounds and shadows of our endless plains and
our forests, which have no history. He is especially
struck with the resemblance of the American
poet to the Scandinavians, such as Tegnèr
and Oehlenschlaeger. He notices even in Longfellow
the Norse tendency to alliteration, and he
quotes one of the Northern poems and then one
of Longfellow’s to show this analogy. It is
worth while to put these side by side. This is
from Oehlenschlaeger:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“<em>T</em>i<em>l</em>giv <em>t</em>vu<em>n</em>gne</div>
<div class="line"><em>T</em>rae<em>l</em> af E<em>l</em>skov!</div>
<div class="line"><em>At</em> han dig <em>a</em>tter</div>
<div class="line"><em>A</em>s<em>t</em>saeld findet.” ... etc.</div>
</div>

<p>The following is by Longfellow:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“<em>F</em>uller of <em>f</em>ragrance, <em>th</em>an <em>th</em>ey</div>
<div class="line">And as heavy with sha<em>d</em>ows and night-<em>d</em>ews,</div>
<span id="pg_197" class="page_anchor">197 </span>
  <div class="line2"><em>H</em>ung the <em>h</em>eart of the <em>m</em>aiden.</div>
  <div class="line2">The cal<em>m</em> and <em>m</em>agical <em>m</em>oonlight</div>
<div class="line">See<em>m</em>ed to inundate her soul.”</div>
</div>

<p>It is curious to notice that Chasles makes the
same criticism on “Evangeline” that Holmes
made on Lowell’s “Vision of Sir Launfal;”
namely, that there is in it a mixture of the artificial
and the natural. The result is, we may
infer, that on the whole one still thinks of it as
a work of art and does not—as, for instance,
with Tolstoi’s “Cossacks”—think of all the
characters as if they lived in the very next
street. Yet it is in its way so charming, he
finds that although as he says, “There is no
passion in it,” still there is a perpetual air of
youth and innocence and tenderness. M. Chasles
is also impressed as a Catholic with the poet’s
wide and liberal comprehension of the Christian
ideas. It is not, he thinks, a masterpiece (<em>Il
y a loin d’Evangéline à un chef-d’œuvre</em>), but
he points out, what time has so far vindicated,
that it has qualities which guarantee to it something
like immortality. When we consider that
Chasles wrote at a time when all our more substantial
literature seemed to him to consist of
uninteresting state histories and extensive collections
of the correspondence of American
presidents—a time when he could write sadly:
“All America does not yet possess a humorist”
<span id="pg_198" class="page_anchor">198 </span>(<em>Toute l’Amérique ne possède pas un humoriste</em>),
one can place it to the credit of Longfellow
that he had already won for himself some
sort of literary standing in the presence of one
Frenchman. At the time of this complaint, it may
be noticed that Mr. S. L. Clemens was a boy of
fifteen. The usual European criticism at the
present day is not that America produces so few
humorists, but that she brings forth so many.</p>

<p>The work which came next from Longfellow’s
pen has that peculiar value to a biographer
which comes from a distinct, unequivocal, low-water
mark in the intellectual product with
which he has to deal. This book, “Kavanagh,”
had the curious fate of bringing great disappointment
to most of his friends and admirers,
and yet of being praised by the two among his
contemporaries personally most successful in fiction,
Hawthorne and Howells. Now that the
New England village life has proved such rich
material in the hands of Mary Wilkins, Sarah
Jewett, and Rowland Robinson, it is difficult
to revert to “Kavanagh” (1849) without feeling
that it is from beginning to end a piece
of purely academic literature without a type of
character, or an incident—one might almost
say without a single phrase—that gives quite
the flavor of real life. Neither the joys nor the
griefs really reach the reader’s heart for one
<span id="pg_199" class="page_anchor">199 </span>moment. All the characters use essentially the
same dialect, and every sentence is duly supplied
with its anecdote or illustration, each one
of which is essentially bookish at last. It has
been well said of it that it is an attempt to look
at rural society as Jean Paul would have looked
at it. Indeed, we find Longfellow reading aloud
from the “Campaner Thal” while actually at
work on “Kavanagh,” and he calls the latter in
his diary “a romance.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_78" id="fnc_78">[78]</a> When we consider
how remote Jean Paul seems from the present
daily life of Germany, one feels the utter inappropriateness
of his transplantation to New England.
Yet Emerson read the book “with great
contentment,” and pronounced it “the best sketch
we have seen in the direction of the American
novel,” and discloses at the end the real charm
he found or fancied by attributing to it “elegance.”
Hawthorne, warm with early friendship,
pronounces it “a most precious and rare
book, as fragrant as a bunch of flowers and as
simple as one flower.... Nobody but yourself
would dare to write so quiet a book, nor could
any other succeed in it. It is entirely original,
a book by itself, a true work of genius, if ever
there was one.” Nothing, I think, so well shows
us the true limitations of American literature
at that period as these curious phrases. It is
<span id="pg_200" class="page_anchor">200 </span>fair also to recognize that Mr. W. D. Howells,
writing nearly twenty years later, says with
almost equal exuberance, speaking of “Kavanagh,”
“It seems to us as yet quite unapproached
by the multitude of New England romances that
have followed it in a certain delicate truthfulness,
as it is likely to remain unsurpassed in its
light humor and pensive grace.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_79" id="fnc_79">[79]</a></p>

<p>The period following the publication of
“Evangeline” seemed a more indeterminate
and unsettled time than was usual with Longfellow.
He began a dramatic romance of the
age of Louis XIV., but did not persist in it,
and apart from the story of “Kavanagh” did
no extended work. He continued to publish
scattered poems, and in two years (1850) there
appeared another volume called “The Seaside
and the Fireside” in which the longest contribution
and the most finished—perhaps the most
complete and artistic which he ever wrote—was
called “The Building of the Ship.” To those
who remember the unequalled voice and dramatic
power of Mrs. Kemble, it is easy to imagine
the enthusiasm with which her reading of this
poem was received by an audience of three thousand,
and none the less because at that troubled
time the concluding appeal to the Union had a
distinct bearing on the conflicts of the time. For
<span id="pg_201" class="page_anchor">201 </span>the rest of the volume, it included the strong
and lyric verses called “Seaweed,” which were
at the time criticised by many, though unreasonably,
as rugged and boisterous; another poem of
dramatic power, “Sir Humphrey Gilbert;” and
one of the most delicately imaginative and musical
among all he ever wrote, “The Fire of Drift-Wood,”
the scene of which was the Devereux
Farm at Marblehead. There were touching
poems of the fireside, especially that entitled
“Resignation,” written in 1848 after the death
of his little daughter Fanny, and one called
“The Open Window.” Looking back from
this, his fourth volume of short poems, it must
be owned that he had singularly succeeded in
providing against any diminution of power or
real monotony. Nevertheless his next effort was
destined to be on a wider scale.</p>

<span class="title">RESIGNATION OF PROFESSORSHIP—TO DEATH
OF MRS. LONGFELLOW</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">On</span> the last day of 1853, Longfellow wrote
in his diary, “How barren of all poetic production
and even prose production this last year
has been! For 1853 I have absolutely nothing
to show. Really there has been nothing but the
college work. The family absorbs half the time,
and letters and visits take out a huge cantle.”
Yet four days later he wrote, January 4, 1854,
“Another day absorbed in the college. But why
complain? These golden days are driven like
nails into the fabric. Who knows but they help
it to hold fast and firm?” On February 22, he
writes, “You are not misinformed about my
leaving the professorship. I am ‘pawing to get
free.’” On his birthday, February 27, he writes,
in the joy of approaching freedom, “I am curious
to know what poetic victories, if any, will be won
this year.” On April 19 he writes, “At eleven
o’clock in No. 6 University Hall, I delivered my
last lecture—the last I shall ever deliver, here
<span id="pg_203" class="page_anchor">203 </span>or anywhere.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_80" id="fnc_80">[80]</a> The following are the letters

<p>His retirement was not a matter of ill health,
for he was perfectly well, except that he could
not use his eyes by candle-light. But friends
and guests and children and college lectures had
more and more filled up his time, so that he had
no strength for poetry, and the last two years
had been very unproductive. There was, moreover,
all the excitement of his friend Sumner’s
career, and of the fugitive slave cases in Boston,
and it is no wonder that he writes in his diary,
with his usual guarded moderation, “I am not,
<span id="pg_207" class="page_anchor">207 </span>however, very sure as to the result.” Meanwhile
he sat for his portrait by Lawrence, and
the subject of the fugitive slave cases brought
to the poet’s face, as the artist testified, a look
of animation and indignation which he was glad
to catch and retain. On Commencement Day,
July 19, 1854, he wore his academical robes for
the last time, and writes of that event, “The
whole crowded church looked ghostly and unreal
as a thing in which I had no part.” He had
already been engaged upon his version of Dante,
having taken it up on February 1, 1853,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_85" id="fnc_85">[85]</a> after ten
years’ interval; and moreover another new literary
project had occurred to him “purely in the
realm of fancy,” as he describes it, and his freedom
became a source of joy.</p>

<p>He had been anxious for some years to carry
out his early plan of works upon American
themes. He had, as will be remembered, made
himself spokesman for the Indians on the college
platform. His list of proposed subjects had
included as far back as 1829, “Tales of the
Quoddy Indians,” with a description of Sacobezon,
their chief. After twenty-five years he
wrote in his diary (June 22, 1854), “I have at
length hit upon a plan for a poem on the American
Indians which seems to be the right one
and the only. It is to weave together their
<span id="pg_208" class="page_anchor">208 </span>beautiful traditions into a whole. I have hit
upon a measure, too, which I think the right one
and the only one for the purpose.” He had to
draw for this delineation not merely upon the
Indians seen in books, but on those he had himself
observed in Maine, the Sacs and Foxes he
had watched on Boston Common, and an Ojibway
chief whom he had entertained at his house.
As for the poetic measure, a suitable one had
just been suggested to him by the Finnish epic
of “Kalevala,” which he had been reading; and
he had been delighted by its appropriateness to
the stage character to be dealt with and the type
of legend to be treated. “Hiawatha” was begun
on June 25, 1854, and published on November
10 of that year. He enjoyed the work thoroughly,
but it evidently seemed to him somewhat
tame before he got through, and this tendency
to tameness was sometimes a subject of criticism
with readers; but its very simplicity made
the style attractive to children and gave a charm
which it is likely always to retain. With his
usual frankness, he stated at the outset that the
metre was not original with him, and it was of
course a merit in the legends that they were not
original. The book received every form of attention;
it was admired, laughed at, parodied,
set to music, and publicly read, and his fame
unquestionably rests far more securely on this
<span id="pg_209" class="page_anchor">209 </span>and other strictly American poems than on the
prolonged labor of the “Golden Legend.” He
himself writes that some of the newspapers are
“fierce and furious” about “Hiawatha,” and
again “there is the greatest pother over ‘Hiawatha.’”
Freiligrath, who translated the poem
into German, writes him from London, “Are
you not chuckling over the war which is waging
in the ‘Athenæum’ about the measure from
‘Hiawatha’?” He had letters of hearty approval
from Emerson, Hawthorne, Parsons, and
Bayard Taylor; the latter, perhaps, making the
best single encomium on the book in writing to its
author, “The whole poem floats in an atmosphere
of the American ‘Indian summer.’” The best
tribute ever paid to it, however, was the actual
representation of it as a drama by the Ojibway
Indians on an island in Lake Huron, in August,
1901, in honor of a visit to the tribe by some
of the children and grandchildren of the poet.
This posthumous tribute to a work of genius is
in itself so picturesque and interesting and has
been so well described by Miss Alice Longfellow,
who was present, that I have obtained her consent
to reprint it in the Appendix to this volume.</p>

<p>Longfellow’s next poem reverted to hexameters
once more, inasmuch as “Evangeline” had thoroughly
outlived the early criticisms inspired by
<span id="pg_210" class="page_anchor">210 </span>this meter. The theme had crossed his mind in
1856, and he had begun to treat it in dramatic
form and verse, under the name it now bears;
but after a year’s delay he tried it again under
the name of Priscilla, taking the name, possibly,
from an attractive English Quakeress, Priscilla
Green, whose sweet voice had charmed him in a
public meeting, “breaking now and then,” as he
says, “into a kind of rhythmic charm in which
the voice seemed floating up and down on wings.”
It has been thought that he transferred in some
degree the personality of this worthy woman to
the heroine of his story, their Christian names being
the same; but he afterwards resumed the original
title, “The Courtship of Miles Standish.”
He wrote it with great ease between December,
1857, and March, 1858, and perhaps never composed
anything with a lighter touch or more unmingled
pleasure. Twenty-five thousand copies
were sold or ordered of the publishers during
the first week, and ten thousand in London on
the first day. In both theme and treatment the
story was thoroughly to his liking, and vindicated
yet further that early instinct which guided him
to American subjects. Longfellow was himself
descended, it will be remembered, from the very
marriage he described, thus guaranteeing a sympathetic
treatment, while the measure is a shade
crisper and more elastic than that of “Evangeline,”
<span id="pg_211" class="page_anchor">211 </span>owing largely to the greater use of trochees.
It is almost needless to say that no such effort can
ever be held strictly to the classic rules, owing
to the difference in the character of the language.
With German hexameters the analogy
is closer.</p>

<p>On July 10, 1861, Mrs. Longfellow died the
tragic death which has been so often described,
from injuries received by fire the day before.
Never was there a greater tragedy within a household;
never one more simply and nobly borne.
It was true to Lowell’s temperament to write
frankly his sorrow in exquisite verse; but it
became Longfellow’s habit, more and more, to
withhold his profoundest feelings from spoken
or written utterance; and it was only after his
death that his portfolio, being opened, revealed
this sonnet, suggested by a picture of the western
mountain whose breast bears the crossed
furrows.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-18">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<span class="title">BIRDS OF PASSAGE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Longfellow</span> had always a ready faculty for
grouping his shorter poems in volumes, and had
a series continuing indefinitely under the name
of “Birds of Passage,” which in successive
“flights” were combined with longer works.
The first was contained in the volume called
“The Courtship of Miles Standish” (1858);
the second in “Tales of a Wayside Inn”
(1863); flight the third appeared in connection
with “Aftermath” (1873); flight the fourth in
“Masque of Pandora and Other Poems” (1875),
and flight the fifth in “Keramos and Other
Poems” (1878). These short poems stand representative
of his middle life, as “Voices of
the Night” and “Ballads” did for the earlier;
and while the maturer works have not, as a whole,
the fervor and freshness of the first, they have
more average skill of execution.</p>

<p>The “Tales of a Wayside Inn” was the final
grouping of several stories which had accumulated
upon him, large and small, and finally demanded
a title-page in common. Some of them
<span id="pg_214" class="page_anchor">214 </span>had been published before and were grouped
into a volume in 1863, which, making itself
popular, was followed by two more volumes,
finally united into one. We have what is not
usually the case, the poet’s own account of them,
he having written thus to a correspondent in England:
“‘The Wayside Inn’ has more foundation
in fact than you may suppose. The town of
Sudbury is about twenty miles from Cambridge.
Some two hundred years ago, an English family
by the name of Howe built there a country
house, which has remained in the family down
to the present time, the last of the race dying
but two years ago. Losing their fortune, they
became innkeepers; and for a century the Red-Horse
Inn has flourished, going down from
father to son. The place is just as I have described
it, though no longer an inn. All this
will account for the landlord’s coat-of-arms, and
his being a justice of the peace, and his being
known as ‘the Squire,’—things that must
sound strange in English ears. All the characters
are real. The musician is Ole Bull; the
Spanish Jew, Israel Edrehi, whom I have seen
as I have painted him,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Other participants in the imaginary festivities
are the late Thomas W. Parsons, the translator of
Dante, who appears as the poet; the theologian
being Professor Daniel Treadwell of Harvard
<span id="pg_215" class="page_anchor">215 </span>University, an eminent physicist, reputed in his
day to be not merely a free thinker, but something
beyond it; the student being Henry Ware
Wales, a promising scholar and lover of books,
who left his beautiful library to the Harvard
College collection; and the Sicilian being Luigi
Monti, who had been an instructor in Italian at
Harvard under Longfellow. Several of this
group had habitually spent their summers in
the actual inn which Longfellow described and
which is still visible at Sudbury. But none of
the participants in the supposed group are now
living except Signor Monti, who still resides in
Rome, as for many years back, with his American
wife, a sister of the poet Parsons. All the
members of the group were well known in Cambridge
and Boston, especially Ole Bull, who was
at seventy as picturesque in presence and bearing
as any youthful troubadour, and whose
American wife, an active and courageous philanthropist,
still vibrates between America and
India, and is more or less allied to the Longfellow
family by the marriage of her younger
brother, Mr. J. G. Thorp, to the poet’s youngest
daughter. The volume has always been popular,
even its most ample form; yet most of the
individual poems are rarely quoted, and with the
exception of “Paul Revere’s Ride” and “Lady
Wentworth” they are not very widely read.
<span id="pg_216" class="page_anchor">216 </span>These two are, it is to be observed, the most
essentially American among them. The book
was originally to have been called “The Sudbury
Tales,” and was sent to the printer in
April, 1863, under that title, which was however
changed to “Tales of a Wayside Inn,”
through the urgency of Charles Sumner.</p>

<p>It is the common fate of those poets who live
to old age, that their critics, or at least their contemporary
critics, are apt to find their later work
less valuable than their earlier. Browning,
Tennyson, and Swinburne, to mention no others,
have had to meet this fate, and Longfellow did
not escape it. Whether it is that the fame of
the earlier work goes on accumulating while
the later has not yet been tested by time, or
that contemporary admirers have grown older
and more critical when they are introduced to
the later verses, this is hard to decide. Even
when the greatest of modern poets completed in
old age the dream of his youth, it was the fashion
for a long time to regard the completion as
a failure, and it took years to secure any real
appreciation to the second part of “Faust.”
This possibility must always be allowed for,
but the fact remains that the title which Longfellow
himself chose for so many of his poems,
“Birds of Passage,” was almost painfully
suggestive of a series of minor works of which
<span id="pg_217" class="page_anchor">217 </span>we can only say that had his fame rested on
those alone, it would have been of quite uncertain
tenure. A very few of them, like “Keramos,”
“Morituri Salutamus,” and “The Herons
of Elmwood,” stand out as exceptions, and above
all of these was the exquisite sonnet already
printed in this volume, “The Cross of Snow,”
recording at last the poet’s high water-mark,
as was the case with Tennyson’s “Crossing the
Bar.” Apart from these, it may be truly said
that the little volume called “Flower de Luce”
was the last collection published by him which
recalled his earlier strains. His volume “Ultima
Thule” appeared in 1880, and “In the
Harbor,” classed as a second part to it, but issued
by others after his death. With these
might be placed, though not with any precision,
the brief tragedy of “Judas Maccabæus,” which
had been published in the “Three Books of
Song,” in 1872; and the unfinished fragment,
“Michael Angelo,” which was found in his desk
after death. None of his dramatic poems showed
him to be on firm ground in respect to this
department of poesy, nor can they, except the
“Golden Legend,” be regarded as altogether
successful literary undertakings. It is obvious
that historic periods differ wholly in this respect;
and all we can say is that while quite mediocre
poets were good dramatists in the Elizabethan
<span id="pg_218" class="page_anchor">218 </span>period, yet good poets have usually failed as
dramatists in later days. Longfellow’s efforts
on this very ground were not less successful, on
the whole, than those of Tennyson and Swinburne;
nor does even Browning, tried by the
test of the actual stage, furnish a complete exception.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-19">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<span class="title">LAST TRIP TO EUROPE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">On</span> May 27, 1868, Longfellow sailed from
New York for Liverpool in the steamer Russia,
with a large family party, including his son and
his son’s bride, his three young daughters, his
brother and two sisters, with also a brother-in-law,
the brilliant Thomas G. Appleton. On
arrival they went at once to the English lakes,
visiting Furness Abbey, Corby Castle, and Eden
Hall, where he saw still unimpaired the traditional
goblet which Uhland’s ballad had vainly
attempted to shatter. At Morton, near Carlisle,
while staying with a friend he received a public
address, to which he thus replied, in one of the
few speeches of his life:—</p>

<p>“<span class="salutation">Mr. President and Gentlemen</span>,—Being
more accustomed to speak with the pen than
with the tongue, it is somewhat difficult for me
to find appropriate words now to thank you for
the honor you have done me, and the very kind
expressions you have used. Coming here as a
stranger, this welcome makes me feel that I am
not a stranger; for how can a man be a stranger
<span id="pg_220" class="page_anchor">220 </span>in a country where he finds all doors and all
hearts open to him? Besides, I myself am a
Cumberland man,—I was born in the County
of Cumberland, in the State of Maine, three
thousand miles from here,—and you all know
that the familiar name of a town or country has
a homelike sound to our ears.... You can
think then how very grateful it is to me—how
very pleasant—to find my name has a place in
your memories and your affections. For this
kindness I most heartily thank you, and I reciprocate
all the good wishes which you have
expressed for perpetual peace and amity between
our two nations.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_86" id="fnc_86">[86]</a></p>

<p>He received the honorary degree of Doctor
of Laws at Cambridge, and the scene was thus
described by a London reporter:—</p>

<p>“Amid a score or so of Heads of Houses and
other Academic dignitaries conspicuous by their
scarlet robes, the one on whom all eyes were
turned was Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The
face was one which would have caught the spectator’s
glance, even if not called to it by the
cheers which greeted his appearance in the red
robes of an LL. D. Long, white, silken hair and
a beard of patriarchal whiteness enclosed a fresh-colored
countenance, with fine-cut features and
deep-sunken eyes, overshadowed by massive eyebrows.
<span id="pg_221" class="page_anchor">221 </span>In a few well-rounded Latin sentences,
Mr. Clark, the Public Orator, recited the claims
of the distinguished visitor to the privilege of an
honorary degree. The names of Hiawatha and
Evangeline sounded strangely amid the sonorous
periods.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_87" id="fnc_87">[87]</a></p>

<p>Another journalist wrote that the orator
“drew a picture of the function of poetry to
solace the ills of life and draw men from its
low cares <em>ad excelsiora</em>. This point was caught
at once by the undergraduates and drew forth
hearty cheering. The degree was then conferred.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_88" id="fnc_88">[88]</a></p>

<p>Arriving in London he received a deluge of
cards and invitations; visited Windsor by invitation
of the Queen, and was received in one
of the galleries of the castle; called by request
upon the Prince of Wales; and was entertained
at dinner by Mr. Bierstadt, the landscape painter,
who had several hundred people to meet him.
Mr. Longfellow had stipulated that there should
be no speeches, but after dinner there were loud
calls for Mr. Gladstone, who said in reply, according
to the reporters, that “they must be
permitted to break through the restrictions
which the authority of their respected host had
imposed upon them, and to give expression to
the feelings which one and all entertained on
<span id="pg_222" class="page_anchor">222 </span>this occasion. After all, it was simply impossible
to sit at the social board with a man of
Mr. Longfellow’s world-wide fame, without offering
him some tribute of their admiration.
There was perhaps no class of persons less fitted
to do justice to an occasion of this character than
those who were destined to tread the toilsome
and dusty road of politics. Nevertheless, he
was glad to render his tribute of hearty admiration
to one whom they were glad to welcome not
only as a poet but as a citizen of America.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_89" id="fnc_89">[89]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Longfellow replied that “they had taken
him by surprise, a traveller just landed and with
Bradshaw still undigested upon his brain, and
they would not expect him to make a speech.
There were times, indeed, when it was easier to
speak than to act; but it was not so with him,
now. He would, however, be strangely constituted
if he did not in his heart respond to their
kind and generous welcome. In the longest
speech he could make, he could but say in
many phrases what he now said in a few sincere
words,—that he was deeply grateful for the
kindness which had been shown him.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_90" id="fnc_90">[90]</a></p>

<p>After visiting the House of Lords with Mr.
R. C. Winthrop, on one occasion, he was accosted
by a laboring man in the street, who asked permission
to speak with him, and recited a verse
<span id="pg_223" class="page_anchor">223 </span>of “Excelsior,” before which the poet promptly
retreated. Passing to the continent, the party
visited Switzerland, crossed by the St. Gothard
Pass to Italy, and reached Cadenabbia, on the
Lake of Como. They returned to Paris in the
autumn; then went to Italy again, staying at
Florence and Rome, where they saw the Abbé
Liszt and obtained that charming sketch of him
by Healy, in which the great musician is seen
opening the inner door and bearing a candle in
his hand. In the spring they visited Naples,
Venice, and Innsbruck, returning then to England,
where Longfellow received the degree of
D. C. L. at Oxford; and they then visited
Devonshire, Edinburgh, and the Scottish lakes.
He again received numberless invitations in
London, and wrote to Lowell, “It is only by
dint of great resolution that I escaped a dozen
public and semi-public dinners.” At the very
last moment before sailing, he received a note
from Mr. E. J. Reed, the chief constructor to
the British Navy, who pronounced his poem “The
Building of the Ship” to be the finest poem on
shipbuilding that ever was or ever would be
written. He reached home September 1, 1869.
In his letters during this period, one sees the serene
head of a family, the absolutely unspoiled
recipient of praise, but not now the eager and
enthusiastic young pilgrim of romance. Yet he
<span id="pg_224" class="page_anchor">224 </span>writes to his friend Ferguson that if he “said
his say” about York Cathedral, his friends
would think him sixteen instead of sixty; and
again tells his publisher Fields that he enjoys
Lugano—never before visited—to the utmost,
but that “the old familiar place saddened” him.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_91" id="fnc_91">[91]</a>
Many a traveller has had in later life the same
experience.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-20">CHAPTER XX<br>

<span class="title">DANTE</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">We</span> come now to that great task which Longfellow,
after an early experiment, had dropped
for years, and which he resumed after his wife’s
death, largely for the sake of an absorbing occupation.
Eighteen years before, November 24,
1843, he had written to Ferdinand Freiligrath
that he had translated sixteen cantos of Dante,
and there seems no reason to suppose that he
had done aught farther in that direction until
this new crisis. After resuming the work, he
translated for a time a canto as each day’s task,
and refers to this habit in his sonnet on the
subject, where he says:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“I enter here from day to day,</div>
<div class="line">And leave my burden at this minster gate.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The work was not fully completed until 1866,
and was published in part during the following
year.</p>

<p>The whole picture of the manner in which
the work was done has long been familiar to the
literary world, including the pleasing glimpse of
<span id="pg_226" class="page_anchor">226 </span>the little circle of cultivated friends, assembled
evening after evening, to compare notes and
suggest improvements. For many years this
was regarded by students and critics as having
been almost an ideal method for the production
of a great work, and especially of a translation,—a
task where there is always the original text
at hand for reference. As time has gone on,
however, the admiration for the completed work
has gradually been mingled with a growing
doubt whether this species of joint production
was on the whole an ideal one, and whether, in
fact, a less perfect work coming from a single
mind might not surpass in freshness of quality,
and therefore in successful effort, any joint product.
Longfellow had written long before to
Freiligrath that making a translation was “like
running a ploughshare through the soil of one’s
mind,”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_92" id="fnc_92">[92]</a> and it would be plainly impossible to
run ploughshares simultaneously through half
a dozen different minds at precisely the same
angle. The mind to decide on a phrase or an
epithet, even in a translation, must, it would
seem, be the mind from which the phrase or
statement originally proceeded; a suggestion
from a neighbor might sometimes be most felicitous,
but quite as often more tame and guarded;
and the influence of several neighbors collectively
<span id="pg_227" class="page_anchor">227 </span>might lie, as often happens in the outcome of
an ordinary committee meeting, rather in the direction
of caution than of vigor. Longfellow’s
own temperament was of the gracious and conciliatory
type, by no means of the domineering quality;
and it is certainly a noticeable outcome of all
this joint effort at constructing a version of this
great world-poem, that one of the two original
delegates, Professor Norton, should ultimately
have published a prose translation of his own.
It is also to be observed that Professor Norton,
in the original preface to his version, while praising
several other translators, does not so much
as mention the name of Longfellow; and in his
list of “Aids to the Study of the ‘Divine
Comedy’” speaks only of Longfellow’s notes
and illustrations, which he praises as “admirable.”
Even Lowell, the other original member
of the conference, while in his “Dante” essay he
ranks Longfellow’s as “the best” of the complete
translations, applies the word “admirable” only
to those fragmentary early versions, made for
Longfellow’s college classes twenty years before,—versions
which the completed work was apparently
intended to supersede.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to imply that any disloyalty
was shown on the part of these gentlemen either
towards their eminent associate or towards the
work on which they had shared his labors; it is
<span id="pg_228" class="page_anchor">228 </span>only that they surprise us a little by what they
do not say. It may be that they do not praise
the Longfellow version because they confessedly
had a share in it, yet this reason does not quite
satisfy. Nothing has been more noticeable in
the popular reception of the completed work than
the general preference of unsophisticated readers
for those earlier translations thus heartily
praised by Lowell. There has been a general
complaint that the later work does not possess
for the English-speaking reader the charm exerted
by the original over all who can read
Italian, while those earlier and fragmentary
specimens had certainly possessed something of
that charm.</p>

<p>Those favorite versions, it must be remembered,
were not the result of any coöperated labor,
having been written by Professor Longfellow in
an interleaved copy of Dante which he used in
the class room. They were three in number, all
from the “Purgatorio” and entitled by him
respectively, “The Celestial Pilot,” “The Terrestrial
Paradise,” and “Beatrice.” They were
first published in “Voices of the Night” (1839),
and twenty-eight years had passed before the
later versions appeared. Those twenty-eight
years had undoubtedly enhanced in width and
depth Mr. Longfellow’s knowledge of the Italian
language; their labors and sorrows had matured
<span id="pg_229" class="page_anchor">229 </span>the strength of his mind; but it is not so clear
that they had not in some degree diminished its
freshness and vivacity, nor is it clear that the
council of friendly critics would be an influence
tending to replace just those gifts.</p>

<p>If a comparison is to be made between the
earlier and later renderings, the best way would
doubtless be to place them side by side in parallel
columns; and while it would be inappropriate to
present such a comparison here on any large
scale, it may be worth while to take a passage at
random to see the effect of the two methods.
Let us take, for instance, a passage from “Purgatorio,”
canto xxx. lines 22 and 23. They are
thus in the original:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Io vidi già nel cominciar del giorno</div>
<div class="line">La parte oriental tutta rosata,</div>
<div class="line">E l’altro ciel di bel sereno adorno.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The following is Longfellow’s translation of
1839, made by the man of thirty-two:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Oft have I seen, at the approach of day,</div>
<div class="line">The orient sky all stained with roseate hues,</div>
<div class="line">And the other heaven with light serene adorned.”</div>
</div>

<p>The following is the later version, made by
the man of sixty, after ample conference with
friendly critics:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Ere now have I beheld, as day began,</div>
<div class="line">The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,</div>
<div class="line">And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;”</div>
</div>

<span id="pg_230" class="page_anchor">230 </span>

<p class="noindent">I do not see how any English-speaking reader
could hesitate for a moment in finding a charm
far greater in the first version than in the
second, or fail to recognize in it more of that
quality which has made the name of Dante
immortal. If this be true, the only question
that can be raised is whether this advantage has
been won by a sacrifice of that degree of literalness
which may fairly be demanded of a translation
in poetic form. Perfect and absolute
literalness, it must be remembered, can only be
expected of a prose version, and even after the
most perfect metrical translation a prose version
may be as needful as ever. Let us consider for
a moment the two examples as given above. It
may be conceded at the outset that the adverb
<em>già</em> is more strictly and carefully rendered by
“ere” than by “oft,” but the difference is not
important, as any one old enough to describe a
daybreak has undoubtedly seen more than one.
The difference between “the approach of day”
and “as day began” is important, since the last
moment of the approach coincides with the first
moment of the beginning. In the second line,
“la parte oriental” is both more literally and
more tersely rendered by “the orient sky,” than
by the more awkward expression “the eastern
hemisphere,” unless it be claimed that “sky”
does not sufficiently recognize the earth as seen
<span id="pg_231" class="page_anchor">231 </span>in the view; to which it may justly be replied
that the word “hemisphere,” if applied only to
the earth, equally omits the sky, and the two
defects balance each other. “Tinged with rose”
is undoubtedly a briefer expression for the untranslatable
“rosata” than “stained with roseate
hues” would be. The last line of the three finds
an identical rendering in the two versions, and
while “bel sereno” is more literally rendered by
“fair serene” than by “light serene,” yet the
earlier phrase has the advantage of being better
English, serene being there used as an adjective
only, whereas in the later translation it is used
as a noun, a practice generally regarded as obsolete
in the dictionaries. Even where the word is
thus employed, they tell us, it does not describe
the morning light, but indicates, like the French
word “serein,” an evening dampness; as where
Daniel says, “The fogs and the serene offend
us.” Summing up the comparison, so far as
this one example goes, it would seem that the
revised version of Longfellow has but very slight
advantage over its predecessor, while the loss of
vividness and charm is unquestionable.</p>

<p>To carry the test yet farther, let us compare
the three lines, in their two successive versions,
with the prose version of Professor Norton, which
reads as follows: “I have seen ere now at the
beginning of the day the eastern region all rosy,
<span id="pg_232" class="page_anchor">232 </span>while the rest of heaven was beautiful with fair,
clear sky.” Here the prose translator rightly
discards the “oft” of the earlier Longfellow version,
but his “at the beginning” is surely nearer
to the “at the approach” of the first version
than to the less literal “as day began” of the
second. The prose “the eastern region” conforms
to the second version “the eastern hemisphere,”
but surely the Italian “la parte oriental”
is more nearly met by “the orient sky”
than by either of these heavier and more geographical
substitutes, which have a flavor of the
text-book. Both the Longfellow versions have
“the other heaven,” which is a literal rendering
of “l’altro ciel,” whereas “the rest of heaven”
is a shade looser in expression, and “fair, clear
sky” also forfeits the condensation of “light
serene” or “fair serene,” of which two phrases
the first seems the better, for reasons already
given. On the whole, if we take Professor Norton’s
prose translation as the standard, Longfellow’s
later version seems to me to gain scarcely
anything upon the earlier in literalness, while it
loses greatly in freshness and triumphant joyousness.</p>

<p>Nor is this in any respect an unreasonable
criticism. For what does a translation exist,
after all, if not to draw us toward that quality
in the original which the translator, even at his
<span id="pg_233" class="page_anchor">233 </span>best, can rarely reach? Goethe says that “the
translator is a person who introduces you to a
veiled beauty; he makes you long for the loveliness
behind the veil,” and we have in the notes
to his “West-Östliche Divan” the celebrated
analysis of the three forms of translation. He
there says, “Translation is of three kinds:
First, the prosaic prose translation, which is useful
in enriching the language of the translator
with new ideas, but gives up all poetic art, and
reduces even the poetic enthusiasm to one level
watery plain. Secondly, the re-creation of the
poem as a new poem, rejecting or altering all
that seems foreign to the translator’s nationality,
producing a paraphrase which might, in the primal
sense of the word, be called a parody. And,
thirdly, ... the highest and last, where one
strives to make the translation identical with the
original; so that one is not instead of the other,
but in the place of the other. This sort of translation
... ‘approaches the interlinear version,
and makes the understanding of the original a
much easier task; thus we are led into the original,—yes,
even driven in; and herein the
great merit of this kind of translation lies.’”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_93" id="fnc_93">[93]</a></p>

<p>It may be doubted, however, whether Longfellow,
in his remarkable paper “On the Translation of Faust”
<span id="pg_234" class="page_anchor">234 </span>even if left to himself in making his version,
could ever have reached the highest point
attained by Goethe, from the mere difference
between the two languages with which he and
his original had to deal. The charm of Longfellow’s
earlier versions is, after all, an English
charm, and perhaps the quality of Dante can no
more be truthfully transmuted into this than we
can transmute the charms of a spring morning
into those of a summer afternoon, or violets into
roses. Goethe, it is well known, took for his
model as to the language of “Faust” the poetry
of Hans Sachs, Longfellow’s “cobbler bard;”
and Dante’s terse monosyllables were based upon
the language of the people, which he first embodied
in art. To mellow its refreshing brevities
would perhaps be to destroy it, and that which
Mr. Andrews finely says of the “Faust” may
be still more true of the “Divina Commedia,”
that it “must remain, after all, the enchanted
palace; and the bodies and the bones of those
who in other days strove to pierce its encircling
hedge lie scattered thickly about it.” So Mr.
W. C. Lawton, himself an experienced translator
from the Greek, says of Longfellow’s work,
“His great version is but a partial success, for it
essays the unattainable.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_94" id="fnc_94">[94]</a> But if it be possible
to win this success, it is probably destined to be
<span id="pg_235" class="page_anchor">235 </span>done by one translator working singly and not
in direct coöperation with others, however gifted
or accomplished. Every great literary work
needs criticism from other eyes during its progress.
Nevertheless it will always remain doubtful
whether any such work, even though it be a
translation only, can be satisfactorily done by
joint labor.</p>

<p>After all, when others have done their best, it
is often necessary to fall back upon the French
Joubert for the final touch of criticism; and in
his unequalled formula for translating Homer,
we find something not absolutely applicable to
Dantean translation, yet furnishing much food
for thought. The following is the passage:
“There will never be an endurable translation
of Homer, unless its words are chosen with
skill and are full of variety, of freshness, and
of charm. It is also essential that the diction
should be as antique, as simple, as are the manners,
the events, and the personages portrayed.
With our modern style everything attitudinizes
in Homer, and his heroes seem fantastic figures
which personate the grave and proud.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_95" id="fnc_95">[95]</a></p>

<h2 id="chapter-21">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<span class="title">THE LOFTIER STRAIN: CHRISTUS</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">After</span> all, no translation, even taken at its
best, can wholly satisfy an essentially original
mind. Longfellow wrote in his diary, November
19, 1849, as follows: “And now I long to try
a loftier strain, the sublimer Song whose broken
melodies have for so many years breathed through
my soul in the better hours of life, and which I
trust and believe will ere long unite themselves
into a symphony not all unworthy the sublime
theme, but furnishing ‘some equivalent expression
for the trouble and wrath of life, for its
sorrow and its mystery.’”</p>

<p>This of course refers to the great poetic design
of his life, “Christus, a Mystery,” of which
he wrote again on December 10, 1849, “A bleak
and dismal day. Wrote in the morning ‘The
Challenge of Thor’ as prologue or ‘<em>Introïtus</em>’
to the second part of ‘Christus.’” This he laid
aside; just a month from that time he records in
his diary, “In the evening, pondered and meditated
the sundry scenes of ‘Christus.’” Later,
he wrote some half dozen scenes or more of
<span id="pg_237" class="page_anchor">237 </span>“The Golden Legend” which is Part Second of
“Christus,” representing the mediæval period.
He afterwards wished, on reading Kingsley’s
“Saint’s Tragedy,” that he had chosen the theme
of Elizabeth of Hungary in place of the minor
one employed (Der Arme Heinrich), although if
we are to judge by the comparative interest inspired
by the two books, there is no reason for
regret. At any rate his poem was published—the
precursor by more than twenty years of any
other portion of the trilogy of “Christus.” The
public, and even his friends, knew but little of
his larger project, but “The Golden Legend” on
its publication in 1851 showed more of the dramatic
quality than anything else he had printed,
and Ruskin gave to it the strong praise of saying,
“Longfellow in his ‘Golden Legend’ has
entered more closely into the temper of the
monk, for good or for evil, than ever yet theological
writer or historian, though they may have
given their life’s labor to the analysis.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_96" id="fnc_96">[96]</a> It is
to be noted that the passage in the book most
criticised as unjust is taken from a sermon of
an actual Italian preacher of the fifteenth century.
But its accuracy or depth in this respect
was probably less to the general public than its
quality of readableness or that which G. P. R.
James, the novelist, described as “its resemblance
<span id="pg_238" class="page_anchor">238 </span>to an old ruin with the ivy and the rich
blue mould upon it.” If the rest of the long
planned book could have been as successful as
for the time being was the “Golden Legend,”
the dream of Longfellow’s poetic life would have
been fulfilled.</p>

<p>In view of such praise as Ruskin’s, the question
of anachronism more or less is of course
quite secondary. Errors of a few centuries
doubtless occur in it. Longfellow himself states
the period at which he aims as 1230. But the
spire of Strassburg Cathedral of which he speaks
was not built until the fifteenth century, though
the church was begun in the twelfth, when
Walter the Minnesinger flourished. “The Lily
of Medicine,” which Prince Henry is reading
when Lucifer drops in, was not written until
after 1300, nor was St. John Nepomuck canonized
until after that date. The Algerine piracies
did not begin until the sixteenth century. There
were other such errors; yet these do not impair
the merit of the book. Some curious modifications
also appear in later editions. In the passage
where the monk Felix is described in the
first edition as pondering over a volume of St.
Augustine, this saint disappears in later editions,
while the Scriptures are substituted and the passage
reads:—</p>

<span id="pg_239" class="page_anchor">239 </span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Wherein amazed he read</div>

<div class="line">And as a watch in the night;”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in the next line “downcast” is substituted
for “cast down,” in order to preserve the rhyme.
A very curious modification of a whole scene is
to be found where the author ventured in the
original edition (1851) to introduce a young
girl at the midnight <em>gaudiolum</em> or carnival of
the monks, she being apparently disguised as a
monk, like Lucifer himself. This whole passage
or series of passages was left out in the later
editions, whether because it was considered too
daring by his critics or perhaps not quite daring
enough to give full spirit to the scene.</p>

<p>Turning now to “The New England Tragedies,”
we find that as far back as 1839, before
he had conceived of “Christus,” he had
thought of a drama on Cotton Mather. Then a
suggestion came to him in 1856 from his German
friend, Emanuel Vitalis Scherb, of whom
he writes on March 16, 1856: “Scherb wants
me to write a poem on the Puritans and the
Quakers. A good subject for a tragedy.” On
March 25 and 26 we find him looking over
books on the subject, especially Besse’s “Sufferings
of the Quakers;” on April 2 he writes
a scene of the play; on May 1 and 2 he is
<span id="pg_240" class="page_anchor">240 </span>pondering and writing notes, and says: “It is
delightful to revolve in one’s mind a new conception.”
He also works upon it in a fragmentary
way in July and in November, and remarks, in
the midst of it, that he has lying on his table
more than sixty requests for autographs. As a
background to all of this lie the peculiar excitements
of that stormy summer of 1856, when his
friend Sumner was struck down in the United
States Senate and he himself, meeting with an
accident, was lamed for weeks and was unable
to go to Europe with his children as he had intended.
The first rough draft of “<ins title="Note: “Wenlook” in the original">Wenlock</ins>
Christison,” whose title was afterwards changed
to “John Endicott,” and which was the first of
“The New England Tragedies,” was not finished
till August 27, 1857, and the work alternated
for a time with that done on “Miles Standish;”
but it was more than ten years (October 10,
1868) before it was published, having first been
written in prose, and only ten copies printed
and afterwards rewritten in verse. With it was
associated the second New England Tragedy,
“Giles Corey” of the Salem farms, written rapidly
in February of that same year. The volume
never made a marked impression; even the
sympathetic Mr. Fields, the publisher, receiving
it rather coldly. It never satisfied even its
author, and the new poetic idea which occurred
<span id="pg_241" class="page_anchor">241 </span>to him on April 11, 1871, and which was to harmonize
the discord of “The New England Tragedies”
was destined never to be fulfilled. In the
mean time, however, he carried them to Europe
with him, and seems to have found their only
admirer in John Forster, who wrote to him in
London: “Your tragedies are very beautiful—beauty
everywhere subduing and chastening the
sadness; the pictures of nature in delightful
contrast to the sorrowful and tragic violence of
the laws; truth and unaffectedness everywhere.
I hardly know which I like best; but there
are things in ‘Giles Corey’ that have a strange
attractiveness for me.” Longfellow writes to
Fields from Vevey, September 5, 1868: “I do
not like your idea of calling the ‘Tragedies’
sketches. They are not sketches, and only seem
so at first because I have studiously left out all
that could impede the action. I have purposely
made them simple and direct.” He later adds:
“As to anybody’s ‘adapting’ these ‘Tragedies’
for the stage, I do not like the idea of it at all.
Prevent this if possible. I should, however,
like to have the opinion of some good actor—not
a sensational actor—on that point. I should
like to have Booth look at them.” Six weeks
later, having gone over to London to secure the
copyright on these poems, he writes: “I saw
also Bandmann, the tragedian, who expressed
<span id="pg_242" class="page_anchor">242 </span>the liveliest interest in what I told him of the
‘Tragedies.’” Finally he says, two days later,
“Bandmann writes me a nice letter about the
‘Tragedies,’ but says they are not adapted to
the stage. So we will say no more about that,
for the present.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_97" id="fnc_97">[97]</a></p>

<p>“Christus: A Mystery” appeared as a whole
in 1872, for the first time bringing together the
three parts (I. “The Divine Tragedy;” II.
“The Golden Legend,” and III. “The New
England Tragedies”). “The Divine Tragedy,”
which now formed the first part, was not only in
some degree criticised as forming an anti-climax
in being placed before the lighter portions of the
great drama, but proved unacceptable among his
friends, and was often subjected to the charge of
being unimpressive and even uninteresting. On
the other hand, we have the fact that it absorbed
him more utterly than any other portion of the
book. He writes in his diary on January 6, 1871,
“The subject of ‘The Divine Tragedy’ has taken
entire possession of me, so that I can think of
nothing else. All day pondering upon and arranging
it.” And he adds next day, “I find all
hospitalities and social gatherings just now great
interruptions.” Yet he has to spend one morning
that week in Boston at a meeting of stockholders;
on another day Agassiz comes, broken
<span id="pg_243" class="page_anchor">243 </span>down even to tears by the loss of health and
strength; on another day there is “a continued
series of interruptions from breakfast till dinner.
I could not get half an hour to myself all day
long. Oh, for a good snow-storm to block the
door!” Still another day it is so cold he can
scarcely write in his study, and he has “so many
letters to answer.” Yet he writes during that
month a scene or two every day. We know
from the experience of all poets that the most
brilliant short poems may be achieved with wonderful
quickness, but for a continuous and sustained
effort an author surely needs some control
over his own time.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, never yet quite explained,
that an author’s favorite work is rarely that
whose popular success best vindicates his confidence.
This was perhaps never more manifest
than in the case of Longfellow’s “Christus” as
a whole, and more especially that portion of it
on which the author lavished his highest and
most consecrated efforts, “The Divine Tragedy.”
Mr. Scudder has well said that “there is no
one of Mr. Longfellow’s writings which may be
said to have so dominated his literary life” as
the “Christus,” and it shows his sensitive reticence
that the portion of it which was first published,
“The Golden Legend” (1851), gave to
the reader no suggestion of its being, as we now
<span id="pg_244" class="page_anchor">244 </span>know that it was, but a portion of a larger design.
Various things came in the way, and
before “The Divine Tragedy” appeared (1871)
he had written of it, “I never had so many
doubts and hesitations about any book as about
this.” On September 11 in that year he wrote
in Nahant, “Begin to pack. I wish it were over
and I in Cambridge. I am impatient to send
‘The Divine Tragedy’ to the printers.” On
the 18th of October he wrote: “The delays of
printers are a great worry to authors;” on the
25th, “Get the last proof sheet of ‘The Divine
Tragedy;’” on the 30th, “Read over proofs of
the ‘Interludes’ and ‘Finale,’ and am doubtful
and perplexed;” on November 15, “All the
last week, perplexed and busy with final correction
of ‘The Tragedy.’” It was published on
December 12, and he writes to G. W. Greene,
December 17, 1871, “‘The Divine Tragedy’ is
very successful, from the booksellers’ point of
view—ten thousand copies were published on
Tuesday last and the printers are already at
work on three thousand more. That is pleasant,
but that is not the main thing. The only question
about a book ought to be whether it is successful
in itself.”</p>

<p>It is altogether probable that in the strict
views then prevailing about the very letter of
the Christian Scriptures, a certain antagonism
<span id="pg_245" class="page_anchor">245 </span>may have prevailed, even toward the skill with
which he transferred the sacred narratives into
a dramatic form, just as it is found that among
certain pious souls who for the first time yield
their scruples so far as to enter a theatre, the
mere lifting of the curtain seems to convey suggestions
of sin. Be this as it may, we find in
Longfellow’s journal this brief entry (December
30): “Received from Routledge in London,
three notices of ‘The Tragedy,’ all hostile.” He,
however, was cheered by the following letter
from Horace Bushnell, then perhaps the most
prominent among the American clergy for originality
and spiritual freedom:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<div class="date">
<span class="name">Hartford</span>, December 28, 1871.
</div>

<p><span class="salutation">Dear Sir</span>,—Since it will be a satisfaction
to me to express my delight in the success of
your poem, you cannot well deny me the privilege.
When I heard the first announcement of
it as forthcoming, I said, “Well, it is the grandest
of all subjects; why has it never been attempted?”
And yet I said inwardly in the next
breath: “What mortal power is equal to the
handling of it?” The greater and the more
delightful is my surprise at the result. You
have managed the theme with really wonderful
address. The episodes, and the hard characters,
and the partly imaginary characters, you had
<span id="pg_246" class="page_anchor">246 </span>your liberty in; and you have used them well
to suffuse and flavor and poetize the story. And
yet, I know not how it is, but the part which
<em>finds</em> me most perfectly, and is, in fact, the most
poetic poetry of all, is the prose-poem,—the
nearly rhythmic transcription of the simple narrative
matter of the gospels. Perhaps the true
account of it may be that the handling is so delicately
reverent, intruding so little of the poet’s
fine thinking and things, that the reverence incorporate
promotes the words and lifts the ranges
of the sentiment; so that when the reader comes
out at the close, he finds himself in a curiously
new kind of inspiration, born of modesty and
silence.</p>

<p>I can easily imagine that certain chaffy people
may put their disrespect on you for what I consider
your praise. Had you undertaken to build
the Christ yourself, as they would require of
you, I verily believe it would have killed you,—that
is, made you a preacher.</p>

<div class="close">
With many thanks, I am yours,
</div>

<div class="signature">
<span class="name">Horace Bushnell</span>.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_98" id="fnc_98">[98]</a>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>It would not now be easy to ascertain what
these hostile notices of “The Divine Tragedy”
were, but it would seem that for some reason
the poem did not, like its predecessors, find its
<span id="pg_247" class="page_anchor">247 </span>way to the popular heart. When one considers
the enthusiasm which greeted Willis’ scriptural
poems in earlier days, or that which has in later
days been attracted by semi-scriptural prose
fictions, such as “The Prince of the House of
David” and “Ben Hur,” the latter appearing,
moreover, in a dramatic form, there certainly
seems no reason why Longfellow’s attempt to
grapple with the great theme should be so little
successful. The book is not, like “The New
England Tragedies,” which completed the circle
of “Christus,” dull in itself. It is, on the contrary,
varied and readable; not merely poetic
and tender, which was a matter of course in
Longfellow’s hands, but strikingly varied, its
composition skilful, the scripture types well
handled, and the additional figures, Helen of
Tyre, Simon Magus, and Menahem the Essenian,
skilfully introduced and effectively managed.
Yet one rarely sees the book quoted; it
has not been widely read, and in all the vast
list of Longfellow translations into foreign languages,
there appears no version of any part of
it except the comparatively modern and mediæval
“Golden Legend.” It has simply afforded
one of the most remarkable instances in literary
history of the utter ignoring of the supposed
high water-mark of a favorite author.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-22">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<span class="title">WESTMINSTER ABBEY</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Longfellow</span> was the first American to be
commemorated, on the mere ground of public
service and distant kinship of blood, in Westminster
Abbey. The impressions made by that
circumstance in America were very various, but
might be classed under two leading attitudes.
There were those to whom the English-speaking
race seemed one, and Westminster Abbey its
undoubted central shrine, an opinion of which
Lowell was a high representative, as his speech
on the occasion showed. There were those, on
the other hand, to whom the American republic
seemed a wholly new fact in the universe, and
one which should have its own shrines. To this
last class the “Hall of Fame,” upon the banks
of the Hudson, would appeal more strongly than
Westminster Abbey; and it is probable that the
interest inspired by that enterprise was partly
due, at the outset, to the acceptance of Longfellow
in England’s greatest shrine. It may be
fairly said, however, on reflection, that there is
no absolute inconsistency between these two
<span id="pg_249" class="page_anchor">249 </span>opinions. No one, surely, but must recognize
the dignity of the proceeding when an American
writer, born and bred, is, as it were, invited after
death to stand as a permanent representative of
his race in the storied abbey. On the other hand,
it may easily be conceded that the dignitaries of
Westminster are not, of themselves, necessarily
so well versed in American claims as to make their
verdict infallible or even approximate. The true
solution would appear to be that in monuments,
as in all other forms of recognition, each nation
should have its own right of selection, and that
it should be recognized as a gratifying circumstance
when these independent judgments happen
to coincide. The following is the best London
report of the services on this occasion:—</p>

<p>“On Saturday, March 2, 1884, at midday,
the ceremony of unveiling a bust of Longfellow
took place in Poets’ Corner, Westminster Abbey.
It is the work of Mr. Thomas Brock, A. R. A.,
and was executed by desire of some five hundred
admirers of the American poet. It stands
on a bracket near the tomb of Chaucer, and
between the memorials to Cowley and Dryden.
Before the ceremony took place, a meeting
of the subscribers was held in the Jerusalem
Chamber. In the absence of Dean Bradley,
owing to a death in his family, the Sub-Dean,
Canon Prothero, was called to the chair.</p>

<span id="pg_250" class="page_anchor">250 </span>

<p>“Mr. Bennoch having formally announced
the order of proceeding, Dr. Bennett made a
brief statement, and called upon Earl Granville
to ask the Dean’s acceptance of the bust.</p>

<p>“Earl Granville then said: ‘Mr. Sub-Dean,
Ladies and Gentlemen, ... I am afraid I cannot
fulfil the promise made for me of making
a speech on this occasion. Not that there are
wanting materials for a speech; there are materials
of the richest description. There are,
first of all, the high character, the refinement,
and the personal charm of the late illustrious
poet,—if I may say so in the presence of those
so near and so dear to him. There are also the
characteristics of those works which have secured
for him not a greater popularity in the United
States themselves than in this island and in all
the English-speaking dependencies of the British
Empire. There are, besides, very large views
with regard to the literature which is common
to both the United States and ourselves, and
with regard to the separate branches of literature
which have sprung up in each country, and
which act and react with so much advantage one
upon another; and there are, above all, those
relations of a moral and intellectual character
which become bonds stronger and greater every
day between the intellectual and cultivated
classes of these two great countries. I am
<span id="pg_251" class="page_anchor">251 </span>happy to say that with such materials there are
persons here infinitely more fitted to deal than I
could have been even if I had had time to bestow
upon the thought and the labor necessary to
condense into the limits of a speech some of the
considerations I have mentioned. I am glad
that among those present there is one who is
not only the official representative of the United
States, but who speaks with more authority than
any one with regard to the literature and intellectual
condition of that country. I cannot but
say how glad I am that I have been present at
two of the meetings held to inaugurate this
work, and I am delighted to be present here to
take part in the closing ceremony. With the
greatest pleasure I make the offer of this memorial
to the Sub-Dean; and from the kindness we
have received already from the authorities of
Westminster Abbey, I have no doubt it will be
received in the same spirit. I beg to offer you,
Mr. Sub-Dean, the bust which has been subscribed
for.’</p>

<p>“The American Minister, Mr. Lowell, then
said: ‘Mr. Sub-Dean, my Lord, Ladies and
Gentlemen, I think I may take upon myself the
responsibility, in the name of the daughters of
my beloved friend, to express their gratitude to
Lord Granville for having found time, amid the
continuous and arduous calls of his duty, to be
<span id="pg_252" class="page_anchor">252 </span>present here this morning. Having occasion to
speak in this place some two years ago, I remember
that I then expressed the hope that some
day or other the Abbey of Westminster would
become the Valhalla of the whole English-speaking
race. I little expected then that a beginning
would be made so soon,—a beginning at once
painful and gratifying in the highest degree to
myself,—with the bust of my friend. Though
there be no Academy in England which corresponds
to that of France, yet admission to
Westminster Abbey forms a sort of posthumous
test of literary eminence perhaps as effectual.
Every one of us has his own private Valhalla,
and it is not apt to be populous. But the conditions
of admission to the Abbey are very different.
We ought no longer to ask why is so-and-so
here, and we ought always to be able to
answer the question why such a one is not here.
I think that on this occasion I should express
the united feeling of the whole English-speaking
race in confirming the choice which has been
made,—the choice of one whose name is dear
to them all, who has inspired their lives and
consoled their hearts, and who has been admitted
to the fireside of all of them as a familiar friend.
Nearly forty years ago I had occasion, in speaking
of Mr. Longfellow, to suggest an analogy
between him and the English poet Gray; and I
<span id="pg_253" class="page_anchor">253 </span>have never since seen any reason to modify or
change that opinion. There are certain very
marked analogies between them, I think. In
the first place, there is the same love of a certain
subdued splendor, not inconsistent with
transparency of diction; there is the same power
of absorbing and assimilating the beauties of
other literature without loss of originality; and,
above all, there is that genius, that sympathy
with universal sentiments and the power of
expressing them so that they come home to
everybody, both high and low, which characterize
both poets. There is something also in that
simplicity,—simplicity in itself being a distinction.
But in style, simplicity and distinction
must be combined in order to their proper
effect; and the only warrant perhaps of permanence
in literature is this distinction in style.
It is something quite indefinable; it is something
like the distinction of good-breeding, characterized
perhaps more by the absence of certain
negative qualities than by the presence of certain
positive ones. But it seems to me that distinction
of style is eminently found in the poet
whom we are met here in some sense to celebrate
to-day. This is not the place, of course, for
criticism; still less is it the place for eulogy, for
eulogy is but too often disguised apology. But I
have been struck particularly—if I may bring
<span id="pg_254" class="page_anchor">254 </span>forward one instance—with some of my late
friend’s sonnets, which seem to me to be some of
the most beautiful and perfect we have in the
language. His mind always moved straight
towards its object, and was always permeated
with the emotion that gave it frankness and
sincerity, and at the same time the most ample
expression. It seems that I should add a few
words—in fact, I cannot refrain from adding a
few words—with regard to the personal character
of a man whom I knew for more than
forty years, and whose friend I was honored to
call myself for thirty years. Never was a private
character more answerable to public performance
than that of Longfellow. Never have I known
a more beautiful character. I was familiar with
it daily,—with the constant charity of his hand
and of his mind. His nature was consecrated
ground, into which no unclean spirit could ever
enter. I feel entirely how inadequate anything
that I can say is to the measure and proportion
of an occasion like this. But I think I am authorized
to accept, in the name of the people of
America, this tribute to not the least distinguished
of her sons, to a man who in every way,
both in public and private, did honor to the
country that gave him birth. I cannot add
anything more to what was so well said in a
few words by Lord Granville, for I do not
<span id="pg_255" class="page_anchor">255 </span>think that these occasions are precisely the
times for set discourses, but rather for a few
words of feeling, of gratitude, and of appreciation.’</p>

<p>“The Sub-Dean, in accepting the bust, remarked
that it was impossible not to feel, in doing
so, that they were accepting a very great honor
to the country. He could conceive that if the
great poet were allowed to look down on the
transactions of that day, he would not think it
unsatisfactory that his memorial had been placed
in that great Abbey among those of his brothers
in poetry.</p>

<p>“The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved a
vote of thanks to the honorary secretary and the
honorary treasurer, and said he thought he had
been selected for the duty because he had spent
two or three years of his life in the United
States, and a still longer time in some of the
British colonies. It gave him the greater pleasure
to do this, having known Mr. Longfellow
in America, and having from boyhood enjoyed
his poetry, which was quite as much appreciated
in England and her dependencies as in America.
Wherever he had been in America, and wherever
he had met Americans, he had found there
was one place at least which they looked upon as
being as much theirs as it was England’s—that
place was the Abbey Church of Westminster.
<span id="pg_256" class="page_anchor">256 </span>It seemed, therefore, to him that the present
occasion was an excellent beginning of the recognition
of the Abbey as what it had been called,—the
Valhalla of the English-speaking people.
He trusted this beginning would not be the end
of its application in this respect.</p>

<p>“The company then proceeded to Poets’ Corner,
where, taking his stand in front of the covered
bust,</p>

<p>“The Sub-Dean then said: ‘I feel to-day that
a double solemnity attaches to this occasion
which calls us together. There is first the familiar
fact that to-day we are adding another
name to the great roll of illustrious men whom
we commemorate within these walls, that we are
adding something to that rich heritage which we
have received of national glory from our ancestors,
and which we feel bound to hand over to
our successors, not only unimpaired, but even
increased. There is then the novel and peculiar
fact which attaches to the erection of a monument
here to the memory of Henry Longfellow.
In some sense, poets—great poets like him—may
be said to be natives of all lands; but never
before have the great men of other countries,
however brilliant and widespread their fame,
been admitted to a place in Westminster Abbey.
A century ago America was just commencing
her perilous path of independence and self-government.
<span id="pg_257" class="page_anchor">257 </span>Who then could have ventured to
predict that within the short space of one hundred
years we in England should be found to
honor an American as much as we could do
so by giving his monument a place within the
sacred shrine which holds the memories of our
most illustrious sons? Is there not in this a
very significant fact; is it not an emphatic proof
of the oneness which belongs to our common
race, and of the community of our national
glories? May I not add, is it not a pledge that
we give to each other that nothing can long
and permanently sever nations which are bound
together by the eternal ties of language, race,
religion, and common feeling?’</p>

<p>“The reverend gentleman then removed the
covering from the bust, and the ceremony
ended.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_99" id="fnc_99">[99]</a></p>

<h2 id="chapter-23">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<span class="title">LONGFELLOW AS A POET</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> great literary lesson of Longfellow’s life
is to be found, after all, in this, that while he was
the first among American poets to create for himself
a world-wide fame, he was guided from youth
to age by a strong national feeling, or at any rate
by the desire to stand for the life and the associations
by which he was actually surrounded.
Such a tendency has been traced in this volume
from his first childish poetry through his chosen
theme for a college debate, his commencement
oration, his plans formed during a first foreign
trip, and the appeal made in his first really original
paper in the “North American Review.”
All these elements of aim and doctrine were
directly and explicitly American, and his most
conspicuous poems, “Evangeline,” “The Courtship
of Miles Standish,” “Hiawatha,” and “The
Wayside Inn,” were unequivocally American
also. In the group of poets to which he belonged,
he was the most travelled and the most
cultivated, in the ordinary sense, while Whittier
was the least so; and yet they are, as we have
<span id="pg_259" class="page_anchor">259 </span>seen, the two who—in the English-speaking
world, at least—hold their own best; the line
between them being drawn only where foreign
languages are in question, and there Longfellow
has of course the advantage. In neither case, it
is to be observed, was this Americanism trivial,
boastful, or ignoble in its tone. It would be
idle to say that this alone constitutes, for an
American, the basis of fame; for the high imaginative
powers of Poe, with his especial gift
of melody, though absolutely without national
flavor, have achieved for him European fame, at
least in France, this being due, however, mainly
to his prose rather than to his poetry, and perhaps
also the result, more largely than we recognize,
of the assiduous discipleship of a single Frenchman,
just as Carlyle’s influence in America was
due largely to Emerson. Be this as it may, it
is certain that the hold of both Longfellow and
Whittier is a thing absolutely due, first, to the
elevated tone of their works, and secondly, that
they have made themselves the poets of the
people. No one can attend popular meetings in
England without being struck with the readiness
with which quotations from these two poets are
heard from the lips of speakers, and this, while
not affording the highest test of poetic art, still
yields the highest secondary test, and one on
which both these authors would doubtless have
<span id="pg_260" class="page_anchor">260 </span>been willing to rest their final appeal for remembrance.</p>

<p>In looking back over Longfellow’s whole career,
it is certain that the early criticisms upon
him, especially those of Margaret Fuller, had
an immediate and temporary justification, but
found ultimate refutation. The most commonplace
man can be better comprehended at the
end of his career than he can be analyzed at its
beginning; and of men possessed of the poetic
temperament, this is eminently true. We now
know that at the very time when “Hyperion”
and the “Voices of the Night” seemed largely
European in their atmosphere, the author himself,
in his diaries, was expressing that longing
for American subjects which afterwards predominated
in his career. Though the citizen among
us best known in Europe, most sought after by
foreign visitors, he yet gravitated naturally to
American themes, American friends, home interests,
plans, and improvements. He always voted
at elections, and generally with the same party,
took an interest in all local affairs and public
improvements, headed subscription papers, was
known by sight among children, and answered
readily to their salutations. The same quality
of citizenship was visible in his literary work.
Lowell, who was regarded in England as an
almost defiant American, yet had a distinct liking,
<span id="pg_261" class="page_anchor">261 </span>which was not especially shared by Longfellow,
for English ways. If people were ever
misled on this point, which perhaps was not the
case, it grew out of his unvarying hospitality
and courtesy, and out of the fact vaguely recognized
by all, but best stated by that keen critic,
the late Mr. Horace E. Scudder, when he says
of Longfellow: “He gave of himself freely to
his intimate friends, but he dwelt, nevertheless,
in a charmed circle, beyond the lines of which
men could not penetrate.... It is rare that
one in our time has been the centre of so much
admiration, and still rarer that one has preserved
in the midst of it all that integrity of nature
which never abdicates.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_100" id="fnc_100">[100]</a></p>

<p>It is an obvious truth in regard to the literary
works of Longfellow, that while they would have
been of value at any time and place, their worth
to a new and unformed literature was priceless.
The first need of such a literature was no doubt
a great original thinker, such as was afforded us
in Emerson. But for him we should perhaps
have been still provincial in thought and imitative
in theme and illustration; our poets would
have gone on writing about the skylark and the
nightingale, which they might never have seen
or heard anywhere, rather than about the bobolink
and the humble-bee, which they knew. It
<span id="pg_262" class="page_anchor">262 </span>was Emerson and the so-called Transcendentalists
who really set our literature free; yet Longfellow
rendered a service only secondary, in
enriching and refining it and giving it a cosmopolitan
culture, and an unquestioned standing
in the literary courts of the civilized world. It
was a great advantage, too, that in his more
moderate and level standard of execution there
was afforded no room for reaction. The same
attributes that keep Longfellow from being the
greatest of poets will make him also one of the
most permanent. There will be no extreme ups
and downs in his fame, as in that of those great
poets of whom Ruskin writes, “Cast Coleridge
at once aside, as sickly and useless; and Shelley
as shallow and verbose.” The finished excellence
of his average execution will sustain it against
that of profounder thinkers and more daring
sons of song. His range of measures is not
great, but his workmanship is perfect; he has
always “the inimitable grace of not too much;”
he has tested all literatures, all poetic motives,
and all the simpler forms of versification, and he
can never be taken unprepared. He will never
be read for the profoundest stirring, or for the
unlocking of the deepest mysteries; he will
always be read for invigoration, for comfort, for
content.</p>

<p>No man is always consistent, and it is not to
<span id="pg_263" class="page_anchor">263 </span>be claimed that Longfellow was always ready to
reaffirm his early attitude in respect to a national
literature. It is not strange that after he
had fairly begun to create one, he should sometimes
be repelled by the class which has always
existed who think that mere nationality should
rank first and an artistic standard afterwards.
He writes on July 24, 1844, to an unknown
correspondent:—</p>

<p>“I dislike as much as any one can the tone of
English criticism in reference to our literature.
But when you say, ‘It is a lamentable fact that
as yet our country has taken no decided steps
towards establishing a national literature,’ it
seems to me that you are repeating one of the
most fallacious assertions of the English critics.
Upon this point I differ entirely from you in
opinion. A national literature is the expression
of national character and thought; and as our
character and modes of thought do not differ
essentially from those of England, our literature
cannot. Vast forests, lakes, and prairies cannot
make great poets. They are but the scenery of
the play, and have much less to do with the
poetic character than has been imagined. Neither
Mexico nor Switzerland has produced any
remarkable poet.</p>

<p>“I do not think a ‘Poets’ Convention’ would
<span id="pg_264" class="page_anchor">264 </span>help the matter. In fact, the matter needs no
helping.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_101" id="fnc_101">[101]</a></p>

<p>In the same way he speaks with regret, three
years later, November 5, 1847, of “The prospectus
of a new magazine in Philadelphia to
build up ‘a national literature worthy of the
country of Niagara—of the land of forests and
eagles.’”</p>

<p>One feels an inexhaustible curiosity as to the
precise manner in which each favorite poem by a
favorite author comes into existence. In the case
of Longfellow we find this illustrated only here
and there. We know that “The Arrow and the
Song,” for instance, came into his mind instantaneously;
that “My Lost Youth” occurred to him
in the night, after a day of pain, and was written
the next morning; that on December 17, 1839, he
read of shipwrecks reported in the papers and of
bodies washed ashore near Gloucester, one lashed
to a piece of the wreck, and that he wrote,
“There is a reef called Norman’s Woe where
many of these took place; among others the
schooner Hesperus. Also the Sea-Flower on
Black Rock. I must write a ballad upon this;
also two others,—‘The Skeleton in Armor’ and
‘Sir Humphrey Gilbert.’” A fortnight later he
sat at twelve o’clock by his fire, smoking, when
suddenly it came into his mind to write the
<span id="pg_265" class="page_anchor">265 </span>Ballad of the Schooner Hesperus, which he
says, “I accordingly did. Then I went to bed,
but could not sleep. New thoughts were running
in my mind, and I got up to add them to
the ballad. It was three by the clock. I then
went to bed and fell asleep. I feel pleased with
the ballad. It hardly cost me an effort. It did
not come into my mind by lines, but by stanzas.”
A few weeks before, taking up a volume of
Scott’s “Border Minstrelsy,” he had received in
a similar way the suggestion of “The Beleaguered
City” and of “The Luck of Edenhall.”</p>

<p>We know by Longfellow’s own statement to
Mr. W. C. Lawton,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_102" id="fnc_102">[102]</a> that it was his rule to do his
best in polishing a poem before printing it, but
afterwards to leave it untouched, on the principle
that “the readers of a poem acquired a right
to the poet’s work in the form they had learned
to love.” He thought also that Bryant and
Whittier hardly seemed happy in these belated
revisions, and mentioned especially Bryant’s
“Water-Fowl,”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“As darkly limned upon the ethereal sky,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where Longfellow preferred the original reading
“painted on.” It is, however, rare to find a
poet who can carry out this principle of abstinence,
at least in his own verse, and we know
<span id="pg_266" class="page_anchor">266 </span>too surely that Longfellow was no exception;
thus we learn that he had made important alterations
in the “Golden Legend” within a few
weeks of publication. These things show that
his remark to Mr. Lawton does not tell quite
the whole story. As with most poets, his alterations
were not always improvements. Thus, in
“The Wreck of the Hesperus,” he made the
fourth verse much more vigorous to the ear as
it was originally written,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Then up and spoke an old sailór</div>
<div class="line">Had sailed the Spanish Main,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">than when he made the latter line read</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Sailed to the Spanish Main,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as in all recent editions. The explanation doubtless
was that he at first supposed the “Spanish
Main” to mean the Caribbean Sea; whereas it
actually referred only to the southern shore of
it. Still more curious is the history of a line
in one of his favorite poems, “To a Child.”
Speaking of this, he says in his diary,<a class="footnote" href="#fn_103" id="fnc_103">[103]</a> “Some
years ago, writing an ‘Ode to a Child,’ I spoke of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><ins title="Note: absent in the original">‘</ins>The buried treasures of the miser, Time.’</div>
</div>

<p>What was my astonishment to-day, in reading for
the first time in my life Wordsworth’s ode ‘On
the Power of Sound,’ to read</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">‘All treasures hoarded by the miser, Time.’”</div>
</div>

<span id="pg_267" class="page_anchor">267 </span>

<p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, this was not the original
form of the Longfellow passage, which was,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“The buried treasures of dead centuries,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">followed by</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“The burning tropic skies.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">More than this, the very word “miser” was not
invariably used in this passage by the poet, as
during an intermediate period it had been
changed to “pirate,” a phrase in some sense
more appropriate and better satisfying the ear.
The curious analogy to Wordsworth’s line did
not therefore lie in the original form of his own
poem, but was an afterthought. It is fortunate
that this curious combination of facts, all utterly
unconscious on his part, did not attract the attention
of Poe during his vindictive period.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed, however, that Longfellow
apparently made all these changes to satisfy his
own judgment, and did not make them, as Whittier
and even Browning often did, in deference
to the judgment of dull or incompetent critics.
It is to be remembered that even the academic
commentators on Longfellow still leave children
to suppose that the Berserk’s tale in “The Skeleton
in Armor” refers to a supposed story that the
Berserk was telling: although the word “tale”
is unquestionably used in the sense of “tally”
or “reckoning,” to indicate how much ale the
<span id="pg_268" class="page_anchor">268 </span>Norse hero could drink. Readers of Milton
often misinterpret his line,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“And every shepherd tells his tale,”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in a similar manner, and the shepherd is supposed
by many young readers to be pouring out
a story of love or of adventure, whereas he is
merely counting up the number of his sheep.</p>

<p>It will always remain uncertain how far Poe
influenced the New England poets, whether by
example or avoidance. That he sometimes
touched Lowell, and not for good, is unquestionable,
in respect to rhythm; but it will always
remain a question whether his influence
did not work in the other direction with Longfellow
in making him limit himself more strictly
to a narrow range of metrical structure. It was
an admirable remark of Tennyson’s that “every
short poem should have a definite shape like the
curve, sometimes a single, sometimes a double
one, assumed by a severed tress, or the rind of
an apple when flung to the floor.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_104" id="fnc_104">[104]</a> This type
of verse was rarely attempted by Longfellow, but
he chose it most appropriately for “Seaweed”
and in some degree succeeded. Poe himself in
his waywardness could not adhere to it when he
reached it, and after giving us in the original
form of “Lenore,” as published in “The Pioneer,”
<span id="pg_269" class="page_anchor">269 </span>perhaps the finest piece of lyric measure
in our literature, made it over into a form of
mere jingling and hackneyed rhythm, adding
even the final commonplaceness of his tiresome
“repetend.” Lowell did something of the same
in cutting down the original fine strain of the
verses beginning “Pine in the distance,” but
Longfellow showed absolutely no trace of Poe,
unless as a warning against multiplying such
rhythmic experiments as he once tried successfully
in “Seaweed.” On the other hand, with
all his love for Lowell, his native good taste
kept him from the confused metaphors and occasional
over-familiarities into which Lowell was
sometimes tempted.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most penetrating remark made
about Longfellow’s art is that of Horace Scudder:
“He was first of all a composer, and he
saw his subjects in their relations, rather than in
their essence.” As a translator, he was generally
admitted to have no superior in the English
tongue, his skill was unvarying and absolutely
reliable. Even here it might be doubted whether
he ever attained the wonderful success sometimes
achieved in single instances, as, for instance, in
Mrs. Sarah Austen’s “Many a Year is in its
Grave,” which, under the guise of a perfect
translation, yet gives a higher and finer touch
than that of the original poem of Rückert. But
<span id="pg_270" class="page_anchor">270 </span>taking Longfellow’s great gift in this direction
as it was, we can see that it was somewhat akin
to this quality of “composition,” rather than
of inspiration, which marked his poems.</p>

<p>He could find it delightful</p>

<div class="poetry">
          <div class="line6">“To lie</div>
<div class="line">And gaze into a summer sky</div>
<div class="line">And watch the trailing clouds go by</div>
<div class="line">Like ships upon the sea.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But it is a vast step from this to Browning’s
mountain picture</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Toward it tilting cloudlets prest</div>
<div class="line">Like Persian ships to Salamis.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In Browning everything is vigorous and individualized.
We see the ships, we know the nationality,
we recall the very battle, and over these
we see in imagination the very shape and movements
of the clouds; but there is no conceivable
reason why Longfellow’s lines should not have
been written by a blind man who knew clouds
merely by the descriptions of others. The limitation
of Longfellow’s poems reveals his temperament.
He was in his perceptions essentially
of poetic mind, but always in touch with the
common mind; as individual lives grow deeper,
students are apt to leave Longfellow for Tennyson,
just as they forsake Tennyson for Browning.
As to action, the tonic of life, so far as he had
<span id="pg_271" class="page_anchor">271 </span>it, was supplied to him through friends,—Sumner
in America; Freiligrath in Europe,—and
yet it must be remembered that he would not,
but for a corresponding quality in his own nature,
have had just such friends as these. He
was not led by his own convictions to leave his
study like Emerson and take direct part as a
contestant in the struggles of the time. It is a
curious fact that Lowell should have censured
Thoreau for not doing in this respect just the
thing which Thoreau ultimately did and Longfellow
did not. It was, however, essentially a
difference of temperament, and it must be remembered
that Longfellow wrote in his diary
under date of December 2, 1859, “This will be
a great day in our history; the date of a new
Revolution,—quite as much needed as the old
one. Even now as I write, they are leading old
John Brown to execution in Virginia, for attempting
to rescue slaves! This is sowing the
wind to reap the whirlwind, which will come
soon.”</p>

<p>His relations with Whittier remained always
kindly and unbroken. They dined together at
the Atlantic Club and Saturday Club, and Longfellow
wrote of him in 1857, “He grows milder
and mellower, as does his poetry.” He went to
Concord sometimes to dine with Emerson, “and
meet his philosophers, Alcott, Thoreau, and Channing.”
<span id="pg_272" class="page_anchor">272 </span>Or Emerson came to Cambridge, “to take
tea,” giving a lecture at the Lyceum, of which
Longfellow says, “The lecture good, but not of
his richest and rarest. His subject ‘Eloquence.’
By turns he was grave and jocose, and had some
striking views and passages. He lets in a
thousand new lights, side-lights, and cross-lights,
into every subject.” When Emerson’s collected
poems are sent him, Longfellow has the book
read to him all the evening and until late at
night, and writes of it in his diary: “Throughout
the volume, through the golden mist and
sublimation of fancy, gleam bright veins of
purest poetry, like rivers running through
meadows. Truly, a rare volume; with many
exquisite poems in it, among which I should
single out ‘Monadnoc,’ ‘Threnody,’ ‘The Humble-Bee,’
as containing much of the quintessence
of poetry.” Emerson’s was one of the five portraits
drawn in crayon by Eastman Johnson, and
always kept hanging in the library at Craigie
House; the others being those of Hawthorne,
Sumner, Felton, and Longfellow himself. No
one can deny to our poet the merits of absolute
freedom from all jealousy and of an invariable
readiness to appreciate those classified by many
critics as greater than himself. He was one of
the first students of Browning in America, when
the latter was known chiefly by his “Bells and
<span id="pg_273" class="page_anchor">273 </span>Pomegranates,” and instinctively selected the
“Blot in the ’Scutcheon” as “a play of great
power and beauty,” as the critics would say, and
as every one must say who reads it. He is an
extraordinary genius, Browning, with dramatic
power of the first order. “Paracelsus” he describes,
with some justice, as “very lofty, but
very diffuse.” Of Browning’s “Christmas Eve”
he later writes, “A wonderful man is Browning,
but too obscure,” and later makes a similar remark
on “The Ring and the Book.” Of Tennyson
he writes, as to “The Princess,” calling
it “a gentle satire, in the easiest and most flowing
blank verse, with two delicious unrhymed
songs, and many exquisite passages. I went to
bed after it, with delightful music ringing in my
ears; yet half disappointed in the poem, though
not knowing why. There is a discordant note
somewhere.”</p>

<p>One very uncertain test of a man of genius is
his “table-talk.” Surrounded by a group of men
who were such masters of this gift as Lowell,
Holmes, and T. G. Appleton, Longfellow might
well be excused from developing it to the highest
extent, and he also “being rather a silent man,”
as he says of himself, escaped thereby the tendency
to monologue, which was sometimes a subject
of complaint in regard to the other three.
Longfellow’s reticence and self-control saved him
<span id="pg_274" class="page_anchor">274 </span>from all such perils; but it must be admitted, on
the other hand, that when his brother collects a
dozen pages of his “table-talk” at the end of
his memoirs, or when one reads his own list of
them in “Kavanagh,” the reader feels a slight
inadequacy, as of things good enough to be said,
but not quite worth the printing. Yet at their
best, they are sometimes pungent and telling, as
where he says, “When looking for anything lost,
begin by looking where you think it is not;”
or, “Silence is a great peace-maker;” or, “In
youth all doors open outward; in old age
they all open inward,” or, more thoughtfully,
“Amusements are like specie payments. We
do not much care for them, if we know we can
have them; but we like to know they may be
had,” or more profoundly still, “How often it
happens that after we know a man personally,
we cease to read his writings. Is it that we
exhaust him by a look? Is it that his personality
gives us all of him we desire?” There
are also included among these passages some
thoroughly poetic touches, as where he says,
“The spring came suddenly, bursting upon the
world as a child bursts into a room, with a laugh
and a shout, and hands full of flowers.” Or
this, “How sudden and sweet are the visitations
of our happiest thoughts; what delightful surprises!
In the midst of life’s most trivial
<span id="pg_275" class="page_anchor">275 </span>occupations,—as when we are reading a newspaper,
or lighting a bed-candle, or waiting for
our horses to drive round,—the lovely face
appears, and thoughts more precious than gold
are whispered in our ear.”</p>

<p>The test of popularity in a poet is nowhere
more visible than in the demand for autographs.
Longfellow writes in his own diary that on November
25, 1856, he has more than sixty such requests
lying on his table; and again on January 9,
“Yesterday I wrote, sealed, and directed seventy
autographs. To-day I added five or six more and
mailed them.” It does not appear whether the
later seventy applications included the earlier
sixty, but it is, in view of the weakness of human
nature, very probable. This number must have
gone on increasing. I remember that in 1875 I
saw in his study a pile which must have numbered
more than seventy, and which had come in
a single day from a single high school in a Western
city, to congratulate him on his birthday,
and each hinting at an autograph, which I think
he was about to supply.</p>

<p>At the time of his seventy-fourth birthday,
1881, a lady in Ohio sent him a hundred blank
cards, with the request that he would write his
name on each, that she might distribute them
among her guests at a party she was to give on
that day. The same day was celebrated by some
<span id="pg_276" class="page_anchor">276 </span>forty different schools in the Western States,
all writing him letters and requesting answers.
He sent to each school, his brother tells us, some
stanza with signature and good wishes. He was
patient even with the gentleman who wrote to
him to request that he would send his autograph
in his “own handwriting.” As a matter of fact,
he had to leave many letters unanswered, even
by a secretary, in his latest years.</p>

<p>It is a most tantalizing thing to know, through
the revelations of Mr. William Winter, that
Longfellow left certain poems unpublished. Mr.
Winter says: “He said also that he sometimes
wrote poems that were for himself alone, that he
should not care ever to publish, because they
were too delicate for publication.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_105" id="fnc_105">[105]</a> Quite akin
to this was another remark made by him to the
same friend, that “the desire of the young poet
is not for applause, but for recognition.” The
two remarks limit one another; the desire for
recognition only begins when the longing for
mere expression is satisfied. Thoroughly practical
and methodical and industrious, Longfellow
yet needed some self-expression first of all. It
is impossible to imagine him as writing puffs of
himself, like Poe, or volunteering reports of receptions
given to him, like Whitman. He said
to Mr. Winter, again and again, “What you
<span id="pg_277" class="page_anchor">277 </span>desire will come, if you will but wait for it.”
The question is not whether this is the only form
of the poetic temperament, but it was clearly his
form of it. Thoreau well says that there is no
definition of poetry which the poet will not instantly
set aside by defying all its limitations,
and it is the same with the poetic temperament
itself.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-24">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<span class="title">LONGFELLOW AS A MAN</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Longfellow</span> always amused himself, as do
most public men, with the confused and contradictory
descriptions of his personal appearance:
with the Newport bookseller who exclaimed,
“Why, you look more like a sea captain than a
poet!” and a printer who described him as “a
hale, portly, fine-looking man, nearly six feet in
height, well proportioned, with a tendency to
fatness; brown hair and blue eyes, and bearing
the general appearance of a comfortable hotel-keeper.”
More graphic still, and on the whole
nearer to the facts, is this description by an
English military visitor who met him at a reception
in Boston in 1850. I happened upon the
volume containing it amid a pile of literary lumber
in one of the great antiquarian bookstores
of London:—</p>

<p>“He was rather under the middle size, but
gracefully formed, and extremely prepossessing
in his general appearance. His hair was light-colored,
and tastefully disposed. Below a fine
forehead gleamed two of the most beautiful eyes
<span id="pg_279" class="page_anchor">279 </span>I had ever beheld in any human head. One
seemed to gaze far into their azure depths. A
very sweet smile, not at all of the pensively-poetical
character, lurked about the well-shaped
mouth, and altogether the expression of Henry
Wordsworth [<em>sic</em>] Longfellow’s face was most
winning. He was dressed very fashionably—almost
too much so; a blue frock coat of Parisian
cut, a handsome waistcoat, faultless pantaloons,
and primrose-colored ‘kids’ set off his
compact figure, which was not a moment still;
for like a butterfly glancing from flower to
flower, he was tripping from one lady to another,
admired and courted by all. He shook me cordially
by the hand, introduced me to his lady,
invited me to his house, and then he was off
again like a humming bird.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_106" id="fnc_106">[106]</a></p>

<p>A later picture by another English observer is
contained in Lord Ronald Gower’s “My Reminiscences.”
After a description of a visit to
Craigie House, in 1878, he says: “If asked to
describe Longfellow’s appearance, I should compare
him to the ideal representations of early
Christian saints and prophets. There is a kind
of halo of goodness about him, a benignity in his
expression which one associates with St. John
at Patmos saying to his followers and brethren,
‘Little children, love one another!’... Longfellow
<span id="pg_280" class="page_anchor">280 </span>has had the rare fortune of being thoroughly
appreciated in his own country and in
other countries during his lifetime; how different,
probably, would have been the career of Byron,
of Keats, or of Shelley, had it been thus with
them! It would be presumptuous for me, and
out of place, to do more here than allude to
the universal popularity of Longfellow’s works
wherever English is spoken; I believe it is not
an exaggeration to say that his works are more
popular than those of any other living poet.
What child is there who has not heard of ‘Excelsior,’
or of ‘Evangeline,’ of ‘Miles Standish,’
or of ‘Hiawatha’? What songs more
popular than ‘The Bridge,’ and ‘I know a
maiden fair to see’? Or who, after reading the
‘Psalm of Life,’ or the ‘Footsteps of Angels,’
does not feel a little less worldly, a little less of the
earth, earthy? The world, indeed, owes a deep
debt of gratitude to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.... Bidding
me note the beauty of the
autumnal tints that make America in the ‘fall’
look as if rainbows were streaming out of the
earth, Longfellow presented me with a goodly
sample of the red and golden leaves of the previous
autumn, which, although dry and faded, still
glowed like gems; these leaves I brought away
with me, and they now form a garland round the
<span id="pg_281" class="page_anchor">281 </span>poet’s portrait; a precious <em>souvenir</em> of that
morning passed at Craigie House.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_107" id="fnc_107">[107]</a></p>

<p>Lord Ronald Gower then quotes the words
used long since in regard to Longfellow by Cardinal
Wiseman,—words which find an appropriate
place here.</p>

<p>“‘Our hemisphere,’ said the Cardinal, ‘cannot
claim the honor of having brought him forth,
but he still belongs to us, for his works have
become as household words wherever the English
language is spoken. And whether we are
charmed by his imagery, or soothed by his melodious
versification, or elevated by the moral
teachings of his pure muse, or follow with sympathetic
hearts the wanderings of Evangeline, I
am sure that all who hear my voice will join
with me in the tribute I desire to pay to the
genius of Longfellow.’”<a class="footnote" href="#fn_108" id="fnc_108">[108]</a></p>

<p>“We have but one life here on earth,” wrote
Longfellow in his diary; “we must make that
beautiful. And to do this, health and elasticity
of mind are needful, and whatever endangers
or impedes these must be avoided.” It is not
often that a man’s scheme of life is so well fulfilled,
or when fulfilled is so well reflected in his
face and bearing, tinged always by the actual
<span id="pg_282" class="page_anchor">282 </span>mark of the terrible ordeal through which he
had passed. When Sydney Dobell was asked
to describe Tennyson, he replied, “If he were
pointed out to you as the man who had written
the Iliad, you would answer, ‘I can well believe
it.’” This never seemed to be quite true of
Tennyson, whose dark oriental look would rather
have suggested the authorship of the Arab legend
of “Antar” or of the quatrains of Omar Khayyám.
But it was eminently true of the picturesqueness
of Longfellow in his later years, with
that look of immovable serenity and of a benignity
which had learned to condone all human
sins. In this respect Turgenieff alone approached
him, in real life, among the literary
men I have known, and there is a photograph
of the Russian which is often mistaken for that
of the American.</p>

<p>Indeed, the beauty of his home life remained
always visible. Living constantly in the same
old house with its storied associations, surrounded
by children and their friends, mingling with
what remained of his earlier friends,—with his
younger brother, a most accomplished and lovable
person, forming one of his own family, and
his younger sister living near him in a house of
her own,—he was also easily the first citizen of
the little University City. Giving readily his
time and means to all public interests, even those
<span id="pg_283" class="page_anchor">283 </span>called political, his position was curiously unlike
that of the more wayward or detached poets.
Later his two married daughters built houses
close by and bore children, and the fields were
full of their playmates, representing the exuberant
life of a new generation. He still kept his
health, and as he walked to and fro his very
presence was a benediction. Some of his old
friends had been unfortunate in life and were
only too willing to seek his door; and even his
literary enterprises, as for instance the “Poems
of Places,” were mainly undertaken for their
sakes, that they might have employment and
support.</p>

<p>It is a curious but indisputable fact that no
house in Cambridge, even in the tenfold larger
university circle of to-day, presents such a constant
course of hospitable and refined social
intercourse as existed at Craigie House in the
days of Longfellow. Whether it is that professors
are harder worked and more poorly paid, or
only that there happens to be no one so sought
after by strangers and so able, through favoring
fortune, to receive them, is not clear. But the
result is the same. He had troops of friends;
they loved to come to him and he to have them
come, and the comforts of creature refreshment
were never wanting, though perhaps in simpler
guise than now. It needs but to turn the pages
<span id="pg_284" class="page_anchor">284 </span>of his memoirs as written by his brother to see
that with the agreeable moderation of French or
Italian gentlemen, he joined their daintiness of
palate and their appreciation of choice vintages,
and this at a time when the physiological standard
was less advanced than now, and a judicious
attention to the subject was for that reason better
appreciated. His friends from Boston and Brookline
came so constantly and so easily as to suggest
a far greater facility of conveyance than that of to-day,
although the real facts were quite otherwise.
One can hardly wonder that the bard’s muse became
a little festive under circumstances so very
favorable. His earlier circle of friends known
as “the five of clubs” included Professor Felton,
whom Dickens called “the heartiest of Greek
professors;” Charles Sumner; George S. Hillard,
Sumner’s law partner; and Henry R. Cleveland,
a retired teacher and educational writer. Of
these, Felton was a man of varied learning, as
was Sumner, an influence which made Felton
jocose but sometimes dogged, and Sumner eloquent,
but occasionally tumid in style. Hillard
was one of those thoroughly accomplished men
who fail of fame only for want of concentration,
and Cleveland was the first to advance ideas of
school training, now so well established that men
forget their ever needing an advocate. He died
young, and Dr. Samuel G. Howe, a man of worldwide
<span id="pg_285" class="page_anchor">285 </span>fame as a philanthropist and trainer of
the blind, was put in to fill the vacancy. All
these five men, being of literary pursuits, could
scarcely fail of occasionally praising one another,
and were popularly known as “the mutual admiration
society;” indeed, there was a tradition
that some one had written above a review
of Longfellow’s “Evangeline” by Felton, to be
found at the Athenæum Library, the condensed
indorsement, “Insured at the Mutual.” At a
later period this club gave place, as clubs will, to
other organizations, such as the short-lived Atlantic
Club and the Saturday Club; and at their
entertainments Longfellow was usually present,
as were also, in the course of time, Emerson,
Holmes, Lowell, Agassiz, Whittier, and many
visitors from near and far. Hawthorne was
rarely seen on such occasions, and Thoreau never.
On the other hand, the club never included the
more radical reformers, as Garrison, Phillips,
Bronson Alcott, Edmund Quincy, or Theodore
Parker, and so did not call out what Emerson
christened “the soul of the soldiery of dissent.”</p>

<p>It would be a mistake to assume that on these
occasions Longfellow was a recipient only. Of
course Holmes and Lowell, the most naturally
talkative of the party, would usually have the
lion’s share of the conversation; but Longfellow,
with all his gentle modesty, had a quiet wit of
<span id="pg_286" class="page_anchor">286 </span>his own and was never wholly a silent partner.
His saying of Ruskin, for instance, that he had
“grand passages of rhetoric, Iliads in nutshells;”
of some one else, that “Criticism is
double edged. It criticises him who receives
and him who gives;” his description of the contented
Dutch tradesman “whose golden face,
like the round and ruddy physiognomy of the
sun on the sign of a village tavern, seems to say
‘Good entertainment here;’” of Venice, that “it
is so visionary and fairylike that one is almost
afraid to set foot on the ground, lest he should
sink the city;” of authorship, that “it is a mystery
to many people that an author should reveal
to the public secrets that he shrinks from
telling to his most intimate friends;” that “nothing
is more dangerous to an author than sudden
success, because the patience of genius is
one of its most precious attributes;” that “he
who carries his bricks to the building of every
one’s house will never build one for himself;”—these
were all fresh, racy, and truthful, and
would bear recalling when many a brilliant
stroke of wit had sparkled on the surface and
gone under. As a mere critic he grew more
amiable and tolerant as he grew older, as is the
wont of literary men; and John Dwight, then
the recognized head of the musical brotherhood of
Boston, always maintained that Longfellow was
<span id="pg_287" class="page_anchor">287 </span>its worst enemy by giving his warm indorsement
to the latest comer, whatever his disqualifications
as to style or skill.</p>

<p>Holmes said of him in a letter to Motley in 1873:—</p>

<p>“I find a singular charm in the society of
Longfellow,—a soft voice, a sweet and cheerful
temper, a receptive rather than aggressive intelligence,
the agreeable flavor of scholarship
without any pedantic ways, and a perceptible
soupçon of the humor, not enough to startle or
surprise or keep you under the strain of over-stimulation,
which I am apt to feel with very
witty people.”</p>

<p>And ten years later, writing to a friend and
referring to his verses on the death of Longfellow,
printed in the “Atlantic Monthly,” he
said: “But it is all too little, for his life was so
exceptionally sweet and musical that any voice
of praise sounds almost like a discord after it.”</p>

<p>Professor Rolfe has suggested that he unconsciously
describes himself in “The Golden Legend,”
where Walter the Minnesinger says of
Prince Henry:—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“His gracious presence upon earth</div>
<div class="line">Was as a fire upon a hearth;</div>
<div class="line">As pleasant songs, at morning sung,</div>
<div class="line">The words that dropped from his sweet tongue</div>
<div class="line">Strengthened our hearts; or, heard at night,</div>
<div class="line">Made all our slumbers soft and light.”</div>
</div>

<span id="pg_288" class="page_anchor">288 </span>

<p class="noindent">He also points out that this is the keynote of
the dedication of “The Seaside and the Fireside,”
the volume published in 1849.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“As one who, walking in the twilight gloom,</div>
  <div class="line2">Hears round about him voices as it darkens,</div>
<div class="line">And seeing not the forms from which they come,</div>
  <div class="line2">Pauses from time to time, and turns and hearkens;</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“So walking here in twilight, O my friends!</div>
  <div class="line2">I hear your voices, softened by the distance,</div>
<div class="line">And pause, and turn to listen, as each sends</div>
  <div class="line2">His words of friendship, comfort, and assistance.</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown!</div>
  <div class="line2">Thanks for each kindly word, each silent token,</div>
<div class="line">That teaches me, when seeming most alone,</div>
  <div class="line2">Friends are around us, though no word be spoken.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another age or country Longfellow would
have been laurelled, medalled, or ennobled; but
he has had what his essentially republican spirit
doubtless preferred, the simple homage of a nation’s
heart. He had his share of foreign honors;
and these did not come from Oxford and
Cambridge only, since in 1873 he was chosen a
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
and in 1877 of the Spanish Academy. At home
he was the honored member of every literary
club or association to which he cared to belong.
In the half-rural city where he spent his maturer
life—that which he himself described in “Hyperion”
as “this leafy blossoming, and beautiful
<span id="pg_289" class="page_anchor">289 </span>Cambridge”—he held a position of as unquestioned
honor and reverence as that of Goethe
at Weimar or Jean Paul at Baireuth. This
was the more remarkable, as he rarely attended
public meetings, seldom volunteered counsel or
action, and was not seen very much in public.
But his weight was always thrown on the right
side; he took an unfeigned interest in public
matters, always faithful to the traditions of his
friend Sumner; and his purse was always easily
opened for all good works. On one occasion
there was something like a collision of opinion
between him and the city government, when it
was thought necessary for the widening of Brattle
Street to remove the “spreading chestnut-tree”
that once stood before the smithy of the
village blacksmith, Dexter Pratt. The poet
earnestly expostulated; the tree fell, nevertheless;
but by one of those happy thoughts which
sometimes break the monotony of municipal annals,
it was proposed to the city fathers that
the children of the public schools should be invited
to build out of its wood, by their small
subscriptions, a great armchair for the poet’s
study. The unexpected gift, from such a source,
salved the offence, but it brought with it a penalty
to Mr. Longfellow’s household, for the
kindly bard gave orders that no child who
wished to see the chair should be excluded; and
<span id="pg_290" class="page_anchor">290 </span>the tramp of dirty little feet through the hall
was for many months the despair of housemaids.
Thenceforward his name was to these children a
household word; and the most charming feature
of the festival held on the two hundred and
fiftieth anniversary of the settlement of Cambridge
(December 28, 1880) was the reception
given by a thousand grammar-school children
to the gray and courteous old poet, who made
then and there, almost for the only time in his
life, and contrary to all previous expectations,
a brief speech in reply.</p>

<p>On that occasion he thus spoke briefly, at the
call of the mayor, who presided, and who afterwards
caused to be read by Mr. George Riddle,
the verses “From My Arm-Chair,” which the
poet had written for the children. He spoke as
follows:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="salutation">My dear Young Friends</span>,—I do not rise
to make an address to you, but to excuse myself
from making one. I know the proverb says
that he who excuses himself accuses himself,—and
I am willing on this occasion to accuse myself,
for I feel very much as I suppose some of
you do when you are suddenly called upon in
your class room, and are obliged to say that you
are not prepared. I am glad to see your faces
and to hear your voices. I am glad to have this
<span id="pg_291" class="page_anchor">291 </span>opportunity of thanking you in prose, as I have
already done in verse, for the beautiful present
you made me some two years ago. Perhaps
some of you have forgotten it, but I have not;
and I am afraid,—yes, I am afraid that fifty
years hence, when you celebrate the three
hundredth anniversary of this occasion, this
day and all that belongs to it will have passed
from your memory; for an English philosopher
has said that the ideas as well as children of
our youth often die before us, and our minds
represent to us those tombs to which we are
approaching, where, though the brass and marble
remain, yet the inscriptions are effaced by time,
and the imagery moulders away.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, upon his seventy-fifth birthday, there
were great rejoicings in the Cambridge schools,
as indeed in those of many other cities far and
wide.</p>

<p>Craigie House, his residence, has already been
described. In this stately old edifice dwelt the
venerable poet, who was usually to be found in
his ample study, rich with the accumulations of
literary luxury. One might find him seated
with Coleridge’s inkstand before him, perhaps
answering one of the vast accumulations of letters
from the school children of Western cities—an
enormous mass of correspondence, which
<span id="pg_292" class="page_anchor">292 </span>was a little while a delight, and then became
a burden. Before him was a carved bookcase
containing a priceless literary treasure,—the
various editions of his works, and, which was
far more valuable, the successive manuscripts
of each, carefully preserved and bound under
his direction, and often extending to three
separate copies: the original manuscript, the
manuscript as revised for the printer, and the
corrected proofs. More than once his friends
urged him to build a fireproof building for
these unique memorials, as Washington did for
his own papers elsewhere; but the calm and
equable author used to reply, “If the house
burns, let its contents go also.”</p>

<p>The wonder of Mr. Longfellow’s later years
was not so much that he kept up his incessant
literary activity as that he did it in the midst
of the constant interruptions involved in great
personal popularity and fame. He had received
beneath his roof every notable person who had
visited Boston for half a century; he had met
them all with the same affability, and had consented,
with equal graciousness, to be instructed
by Emerson and Sumner, or to be kindly patronized—as
the story goes—by Oscar Wilde.
From that room had gone forth innumerable
kind acts and good deeds, and never a word
of harshness. He retained to the last his sympathy
<span id="pg_293" class="page_anchor">293 </span>with young people, and with all liberal
and progressive measures. Indeed, almost his
latest act of public duty was to sign a petition
to the Massachusetts legislature for the relief
of the disabilities still placed in that State upon
the testimony of atheists.</p>

<p>Mr. Longfellow’s general health remained
tolerably good, in spite of advancing years, until
within about three months of his death. After
retiring to bed in apparent health one night, he
found himself in the morning so dizzy as to be
unable to rise, and with a pain in the top of his
head. For a week he was unable to walk across
the room on account of dizziness, and although
it gradually diminished, yet neither this nor the
pain in the head ever entirely disappeared, and
there was great loss of strength and appetite.
He accepted the situation at once, retreated to
the security of his own room, refused all visitors
outside of the family, and had a printed form
provided for the acknowledgment of letters,
leaving his daughters to answer them. During
the last three months of his life he probably did
not write three dozen letters, and though he saw
some visitors, he refused many more. He might
sometimes be seen walking on his piazza, or even
in the street before the house, but he accepted
no invitations, and confined himself mainly
within doors. His seventy-fifth birthday, February
<span id="pg_294" class="page_anchor">294 </span>27, was passed very quietly at home, in
spite of the many celebrations held elsewhere.
On Sunday, March 19, he had a sudden attack
of illness, not visibly connected with his previous
symptoms. It was evident that the end was
near, and he finally died of peritonitis on Friday
afternoon, March 24, 1882.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be found, as time goes on, that
the greatest service rendered by Longfellow—beyond
all personal awakening or stimulus exerted
on his readers—was that of being the
first conspicuous representative, in an eminently
practical and hard-working community, of the
literary life. One of a circle of superior men,
he was the only one who stood for that life
purely and supremely, and thus vindicated its
national importance. Among his predecessors,
Irving had lived chiefly in Europe, and Bryant
in a newspaper office. Among his immediate
friends, Holmes stood for exact science, Lowell
and Whittier for reform, Sumner for statesmanship,
Emerson for spiritual and mystic values;
even the shy Hawthorne for public functions at
home and abroad. Here was a man whose single
word, sent forth from his quiet study, reached
more hearts in distant nations than any of these,
and was speedily reproduced in the far-off languages
of the world. Considered merely as an
antidote to materialism, such a life was of incalculable
<span id="pg_295" class="page_anchor">295 </span>value. Looking at him, the reign of
the purely materialistic, however much aided by
organizing genius, was plainly self-limited; the
modest career of Longfellow outshone it in the
world’s arena. Should that reign henceforth
grow never so potent, the best offset to its most
arrogant claims will be found, for years to come,
in the memory of his name.</p>

<h3>I<br>

<span class="title">GENEALOGY</span></h3>

<p class="note">[From <em>Life</em>, etc., by Samuel Longfellow, iii. 421.]</p>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> name of Longfellow is found in the records
of Yorkshire, England, as far back as 1486, and
appears under the various spellings of Langfellay,
Langfellowe, Langfellow, and Longfellow. The first
of the name is James Langfellay, of Otley. In 1510
Sir Peter Langfellowe is vicar of Calverley. In the
neighboring towns of Ilkley, Guiseley, and Horsforth
lived many Longfellows, mostly yeomen: some
of them well-to-do, others a charge on the parish;
some getting into the courts and fined for such
offences as “cutting green wode,” or “greenhow,”
or “carrying away the Lord’s wood,”—wood from
the yew-trees of the lord of the manor, to which they
thought they had a right for their bows. One of the
name was overseer of highways, and one was churchwarden
in Ilkley.</p>

<p>It is well established, by tradition and by documents,
that the poet’s ancestors were in Horsforth.
In 1625 we find Edward Longfellow (perhaps from
Ilkley) purchasing “Upper House,” in Horsforth;
and in 1647 he makes over his house and lands to
<span id="pg_298" class="page_anchor">298 </span>his son William. This William was a well-to-do
clothier who lived in Upper House, and, besides,
possessed three other houses or cottages (being taxed
for “4 hearths”), with gardens, closes, crofts, etc.
He had two sons, Nathan and William, and four or
five daughters. William was baptized at Guiseley
(the parish church of Horsforth), October 20, 1650.</p>

<p>The first of the name in America was this William,
son of William of Horsforth. He came over,
a young man, to Newbury, Massachusetts, about
1676. Soon after, he married Anne Sewall, daughter
of Henry Sewall, of Newbury, and sister of Samuel
Sewall, afterward the first chief justice of Massachusetts.
He received from his father-in-law a
farm in the parish of Byfield, on the Parker River.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_109" id="fnc_109">[109]</a>
He is spoken of as “well educated, but a little wild,”
or, as another puts it, “not so much of a Puritan as
some.” In 1690, as ensign of the Newbury company
in the Essex regiment, he joined the ill-fated
expedition of Sir William Phipps against Quebec,
which on its return encountered a severe storm in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. One of the ships was wrecked
on the island of Anticosti, and William Longfellow,
<span id="pg_299" class="page_anchor">299 </span>with nine of his comrades, was drowned. He left
five children. The fourth of these, Stephen (1), left
to shift for himself, became a blacksmith. He married
Abigail, daughter of Rev. Edward Tompson,
of Newbury, afterward of Marshfield. Their fifth
child, Stephen (2), born in 1723, being a bright boy,
was sent to Harvard College, where he took his first
degree in 1742, and his second in 1745. In this latter
year (after having meanwhile taught a school in
York) he went to Portland in Maine (then Falmouth),
to be the schoolmaster of the town.<a class="footnote" href="#fn_110" id="fnc_110">[110]</a></p>

<p>He gained the respect of the community to such a
degree that he was called to fill important offices;
being successively parish clerk, town clerk, register
of probate, and clerk of the courts. When Portland
was burned by Mowatt in 1775, his house having been
destroyed, he removed to Gorham, where he resided
<span id="pg_300" class="page_anchor">300 </span>till his death, in 1790. It was said of him that he
was a man of piety, integrity, and honor, and that
his favorite reading was history and poetry. He had
married Tabitha, daughter of Samuel Bragdon, of
York. Their eldest son, Stephen (3), was born in
1750, inheriting the name and the farm; and in 1773
he married Patience Young, of York. He represented
his town in the Massachusetts legislature for
eight years, and his county for several years after as
senator. For fourteen years (1797–1811) he was
judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and is remembered
as a man of sterling qualities, great integrity,
and sound common-sense. His second child, Stephen
(4), born in Gorham in 1776, graduated at Harvard
College in 1798, studied law in Portland, and in 1801
was admitted to the Cumberland Bar, at which he
soon attained and kept a distinguished position. In
1814, as a member of the Federalist party, to whose
principles he was strongly attached, he was sent as a
representative to the Massachusetts legislature. In
1822 he was elected representative to Congress,
which office he held for one term. In 1828 he received
the degree of LL. D. from Bowdoin College,
of which he was a Trustee for nineteen years. In 1834
he was elected President of the Maine Historical Society.
He died in 1849, highly respected for his integrity,
public spirit, hospitality, and generosity. In
1804 he had married Zilpah, daughter of General
Peleg Wadsworth, of Portland. Of their eight children,
Henry Wadsworth was the second. He was
named for his mother’s brother, a gallant young lieutenant
<span id="pg_301" class="page_anchor">301 </span>in the Navy, who on the night of September 4,
1804, gave his life before Tripoli in the war with
Algiers. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born
on the 27th February, 1807; graduated at Bowdoin
College in 1825; in 1829 was appointed Professor
of Modern Languages in the same college; was married
in 1831 to Mary Storer Potter (daughter of
Barrett Potter of Portland), who died in 1835; in
1836 was appointed Professor of Modern Languages
and Belles-Lettres in Harvard College, which office
he held till 1854. He was again married in July,
1843, to Frances Elizabeth Appleton, daughter of
Nathan Appleton, of Boston. She died in 1861.
Their children were Charles Appleton, Ernest Wadsworth,
Frances (who died in infancy), Alice Mary,
Edith, and Anne Allegra. He died on the 24th
March, 1882.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote" id="fn_109">
<span class="mark"><a href="#fnc_109">[109]</a></span> In 1680 Samuel Sewall wrote to his brother in England:
“Brother Longfellow’s father W<sup>m</sup>. lives at Horsforth, near
Leeds. Tell him bro. has a son William, a fine likely child, and
a very good piece of land, and greatly wants a little stock to
manage it. And that father has paid for him upwards of an
hundred pounds to get him out of debt.” In 1688 William
Longfellow is entered upon the town records of Newbury as
having “two houses, six plough-lands, meadows,” etc. The
year before, he had made a visit to his old home in Horsforth.
</div>

<div class="footnote" id="fn_110">
<span class="mark"><a href="#fnc_110">[110]</a></span> This was the letter from the minister of the town inviting

<span class="title">TRANSLATIONS OF MR. LONGFELLOW’S WORKS</span></h3>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> following catalogue of translations of Mr.
Longfellow’s works is based, of course, upon that prepared
by Mr. Samuel Longfellow for the memoir of
his brother. This is here, however, revised, corrected,
and much enlarged, partly by the addition of later
versions and partly by others gathered from European
bibliographies and publishers’ lists; this work being
aided by the learned guidance of Professor Wiener of
Harvard University. Even with this enlargement
the list is doubtless quite incomplete; so widely scattered
are these translations among the periodicals and
even the schoolbooks of different nations, and so much
time and labor would be required to furnish an absolutely
complete exhibit.</p>

<h3>IV<br>

<span class="title">A VISIT TO HIAWATHA’S PEOPLE</span></h3>

<p><span class="first-word">The</span> following narrative of the reception given to
the Longfellow family by the Ojibway Indians was
prepared by Miss Alice M. Longfellow for the Riverside
Literature Series, and is used by permission.</p>

<blockquote class="text">

<p>When the idea of writing an Indian poem began
first to take form in Mr. Longfellow’s mind, he followed
the adventures of Manabozho (a mythical character,
whose exploits figure largely in all Ojibway
legends) and gave his name to the poem; but feeling
the need of some expression of the finer and nobler
side of the Indian nature, he blended the supernatural
deeds of the crafty sprite with the wise, noble spirit
of the Iroquois national hero, and formed the character
of Hiawatha.</p>

<span id="pg_317" class="page_anchor">317 </span>

<p>Early in the last century the scattered bands of the
Ojibways who had their home near Lake Superior
and Lake Huron, with their principal village at Garden
River in Algoma, not far from Sault Ste. Marie,
were ruled over by Chief Shingwauk, a ruler of force
and character. He held the remnants of the tribe
together, cherished their national pride, and laid great
stress on the importance of preserving the national
legendary history. He imbued his son Bukwujjinini
with the same feeling, and carefully instructed him
in all the legendary lore of his people. Bukwujjinini
became thus well versed in these legends, and it was
from him that Mr. Schoolcraft, who had married
an Indian woman, received them, turning them into
English and printing them in his great work on the
Indians.</p>

<p>The old chief was a fine specimen of the aboriginal
red man, dignified, wise, and thoughtful, and deeply
beloved by his people. He selected his nephew,
George Kabaoosa—or Daguagonay—as his successor
in continuing the legendary history of his people,
constantly repeating to him all he had heard from
his father, and this Kabaoosa is now engaged in writing
out all these legends to preserve them for posterity.
In addition to his knowledge of these tales
from his uncle’s lips, Kabaoosa had heard the poem
of “Hiawatha” read by his Sunday-school teacher in
his youth.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1900 a band of Ojibway Indians
was formed to illustrate Indian life at the Sportsmen’s
Show in Boston. Among them was the old chief
<span id="pg_318" class="page_anchor">318 </span>Bukwujjinini, and one of the inducements he had to
take the journey was the hope of visiting the home
of the writer who had cared enough for the legends
of his people to turn them into poetry. But this
could not be, for the old man, who was over ninety,
fell ill, and died on the very day the Indians were
to set forth, and they took their journey without their
father, and with genuine sorrow in their hearts.</p>

<p>For some time the Canadian gentleman who arranged
the expedition had been cherishing the idea
of training the Indians to perform scenes from “Hiawatha”
in the forest on the shores of the “big sea
water.” Kabaoosa readily fell in with this scheme,
and after the visit of the Indians to Mr. Longfellow’s
home in Cambridge the plan rapidly matured, and a
formal invitation was sent to Mr. Longfellow’s family
to be present at the representation as guests of the
Indians. The invitation was written on birch bark,
in Ojibway, and was as follows:—</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

<p><span class="salutation">Ladies</span>: We loved your father. The memory of
our people will never die as long as your father’s
song lives, and that will live forever.</p>

<p>Will you and your husbands and Miss Longfellow
come and see us and stay in our royal wigwams on an
island in Hiawatha’s playground, in the land of the
Ojibways? We want you to see us live over again
the life of Hiawatha in his own country.</p>

</blockquote>

<span id="pg_319" class="page_anchor">319 </span>

<p>The invitation was cordially accepted, and in August
the party of guests, twelve in all, left the train
at Desbarats on the north shore of Lake Huron;
there they were met by the Indians in full costume,
and in sailboat and canoes they set forth for the little
rocky island, which had been prepared for them.
There was a square stone lodge on the highest part
of the island, most picturesquely finished inside and
out, with the flag of England floating above it. Surrounding
this were several tepees of tanned hide and
stained canvas, and nearer the shore two little groups
of tents, where two Indian families lived, who cooked
and served, sailed the boats, entertained their guests
with songs, dancing, and story-telling, doing all with
a quiet dignity, ease of manner, and genuine kindliness
that removed every difficulty.</p>

<p>The play of “Hiawatha” was performed on a rocky,
thickly wooded point about two miles away. Near
the shore a platform was built around a tall pine-tree,
and grouped around this were tepees and wigwams
forming the Indian village. Behind this the ground
sloped gradually upward, forming a natural amphitheatre.</p>

<p>As a prelude to the play a large pile of brushwood
was lighted.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,</div>
<div class="line">As a signal to the Nations.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Down the hillsides rushed the braves in war-paint
and feathers,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Wildly glaring at each other,</div>
<div class="line">In their hearts the feuds of ages.</div>
<span id="pg_320" class="page_anchor">320 </span>
<div class="line">Then upon the ground the warriors</div>
<div class="line">Threw their weapons and their war-gear,</div>
<div class="line">Leaped into the rushing river,</div>
<div class="line">Washed the war-paint from their faces,</div>
<div class="line">And in silence all the warriors</div>
<div class="line">Broke the red stone of the quarry,</div>
<div class="line">Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes.”</div>
</div>

<p>Then appeared old Nokomis leading by the hand
the youthful Hiawatha, and taught him how to shoot
the bow and arrow, while the warriors stood around
watching and applauding when he hit the mark.</p>

<p>The third scene was the journey of Hiawatha in
his manhood after his battle with Mudjekeewis, a
picturesque figure striding through the woods flecked
with sunshine and shadow.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Only once his pace he slackened,</div>
<div class="line">Paused to purchase heads of arrows</div>
<div class="line">Of the ancient arrow-maker.”</div>
</div>

<p>The wigwam of the ancient arrow-maker was
placed far from the rest in the shade of the trees, to
give an idea of distance. The arrow-maker himself,
a very old man, sat by the entrance, cutting arrowheads;
his daughter, a modest Indian maiden, stood
beside him with downcast eyes, while the stranger
paused to talk with her father.</p>

<p>This scene was followed by the return of Hiawatha
to the land of the Dakotahs. Again the old man sat
in the doorway, and by him was Minnehaha, “plaiting
mats of flags and rushes.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Then uprose the Laughing Water,</div>
<div class="line">Laid aside her mat unfinished,</div>
<span id="pg_321" class="page_anchor">321 </span>
<div class="line">Brought forth food, and set before them,</div>
<div class="line">Gave them drink in bowls of bass wood.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She stood modestly on one side while Hiawatha
urged his suit, and then putting her hand in his, she
followed him home through the forest.</p>

<p>Then came the wedding dances, full of life and
spirit, the figures moving always round and round in
a circle, with a swaying motion, the feet scarcely
lifted from the ground. Under the pine-tree, tall
and erect, with head and eyes uplifted, stood the
musician, chanting his songs with a strange rhythmical
cadence, and accompanying them on the flat
Indian drum.</p>

<p>The old Nokomis in one corner guarded with a
war-club a group of maidens who were dancing all
the while, and the braves circling round slyly stole
one maiden after another, until Nokomis was left
alone. Then followed the caribou dance, the dancers
with arms uplifted like horns, knocking and striking
one another; the bear dance, with its clumsy, heavy
motion; and the snake dance, where the dancers
wound and twisted in and out, round and round; and
always the singer continued his rhythmic chant.</p>

<p>Last came the gambling dance, the favorite with
the actors. A mat of rushes was placed on the
ground, and on each side kneeled the contestants.
At the back stood the old singer, drumming and
chanting advice to the players. On each side were
grouped the women watching the game, their bodies
swaying in time to the music, while the players grew
more and more excited, arms, heads, bodies all moving
<span id="pg_322" class="page_anchor">322 </span>in perfect rhythm, calling out and shouting as
one by one pouches, knives, belts, etc., were passed
to the winning side. One side hid a small metal
counter under one of two moccasins, while the other
side tried to find it.</p>

<p>This game was interrupted by a sudden shout, and
across the water was seen approaching a canoe, and
seated in it the missionary, “the black robe chief, the
prophet.” On the shore he was graciously received
by Hiawatha, and led to a wigwam for refreshment
and repose. Then he addressed the attentive tribes
in Ojibway,—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“Told his message to the people,</div>
<div class="line">Told the purport of his mission.”</div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon Hiawatha arose, greeting the missionary,
took farewell of all his people, and—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“On the clear and luminous water</div>
<div class="line">Launched his birch canoe for sailing.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With hands uplifted he glided slowly out upon the
lake, floating steadily onward across the rippling
water toward the setting sun.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“And the people from the margin</div>
<div class="line">Watched him floating, rising, sinking,</div>
<div class="line">Till the birch canoe seemed lifted</div>
<div class="line">High into that sea of splendor.</div>
<div class="line">And they said, ‘Farewell, forever!’</div>
<div class="line">Said, ‘Farewell, O Hiawatha.’”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A beautiful ending to a most unique and interesting
drama of the forest, with the broad stretch of the lake
in front, and the forest trees closing in the scene.</p>

<p>After this followed an evening of songs and dancing,
<span id="pg_323" class="page_anchor">323 </span>addresses of welcome in Ojibway to the paleface
strangers, and then the return of the guests to
the little island, quietly sailing in the starlight, while
the Indians sang their favorite hymns in the strange
Ojibway tongue. The next day being Sunday, all
the Indians gathered on the island, where a church
was improvised, and a simple service was held in
their native tongue by the English clergyman from
Garden River, who had impersonated the missionary
in the play.</p>

<p>After the service an old man arose, welcoming the
strangers, because their father had written in poetry
the legends of his people, and with pride produced a
large silver medal given to his ancestors by King
George III. as a pledge that their rights should be
respected. “And,” he said, “he told us that as
long as the sun shone the Indians should be happy,
but I see the sun still shining, and I do not think
Indians always happy. But the medal he told us
always to wear when with persons of distinction;”
and with great dignity the old man slipped the medal
with its broad blue ribbon around his neck, looking
proud and happy.</p>

<p>The party of strangers made a visit to Garden
River, the home of the Indians for many generations,
where they were most hospitably received; the old
chief’s house was opened for them, and all his treasures
displayed.</p>

<p>A few days before the end of the visit, the Indians
were very busy building a small platform on the
island, and decorating it with green boughs, doing
<span id="pg_324" class="page_anchor">324 </span>everything with much secrecy. After sunset, when
the fire was lighted on the rocks near by, the Indians
assembled together, and Kabaoosa as the spokesman
announced that they wished to have the pleasure of
taking some of the party into the tribe as members.
First came the ladies, as their father had turned the
Ojibway legends into verse. They were led in turn
before Kabaoosa, who took one of their hands in his,
and made a spirited discourse in Ojibway. Then
striking them three times on the shoulder, he called
aloud the Indian name of adoption, and all the bystanders
repeated it together. Then the new member
of the tribe was led around the circle, and each
Indian came forward, grasping the stranger by the
hand, and calling aloud the new name. The names,
which were valued names in the tribe, were all chosen
with care, and given as proofs of high regard; the
men of the party were honored as well as the women.</p>

<p>Odenewasenoquay, The first flash of the lightning
[Miss Longfellow]; Osahgahgushkodawaquay,
The lady of the open plains [Mrs. J. G. Thorp];
Daguagonay, The man whom people like to camp
near [J. G. Thorp, Esq.]; and the names of the old
chiefs Shingwauk, or Sagagewayosay [Richard Henry
Dana], and Bukwujjinini [Henry W. L. Dana].</p>

<p>The ceremonies were followed by much singing
and dancing, of which the Indians never tire, and the
following day came the farewells,—farewells to the
broad, beautiful lake, the islands, the sweet fragrance
of the forest, and the kind and devoted hosts. With
many regrets the party turned their faces eastward,
<span id="pg_325" class="page_anchor">325 </span>while the Indians accompanied their farewells with a
parting dance.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">“And they said, ‘Farewell forever!’</div>
<div class="line">Said, ‘Farewell, O Hiawatha.’”</div>
